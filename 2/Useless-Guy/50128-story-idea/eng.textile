So I was thinking, what if there was some disease that caused your kidneys to flush all your body's nutrients over a 3 day period? The obvious treatment is to re-ingest the resulting urine-or you can try and keep it inside for 72 hours (I know kidneys can't reabsorb nutrients once they hit the bladder, but we didn't come here for realism). Alternatively, what if there was some sort of pee communicable plague, closing public toilets and forcing infected to hold it until they can find a quarantined bathroom?
