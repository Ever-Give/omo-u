According to TV Tropes' Potty Emergency Page

: "Greenland in a series of Hetalia: Axis Powers fanfictions often suffers from these, either because she's trying on the guys' old traditional clothes and she can't take them off, or because the other countries are ignorant/oblivious to her need. Sometimes she makes it, and sometimes, she doesn't." Annoyingly, there's no link. Has anyone seen the fics they're talking about?
