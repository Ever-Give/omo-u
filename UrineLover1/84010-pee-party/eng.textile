Four good friends go to an exclusive party. But this party is not like any you or I have ever seen, no. This party is a lot stranger… and a lot wetter!

Warning! All of the events in this story are entirely fictional! You should NEVER do these things at a real party. There is also swearing, vulgar language, sexual activities, and obviously urine in this story. As usual, YOU are the ones choosing to read this! If you do not like any of the things listed above, please leave. However, if you are comfortable, enjoy the story!

I wrote this story all at once, so let me know if you want me to post the whole thing now, or post one section a week or something.

Mason and Evelyn climbed into the back of the long black limousine. Inside, they found Annie and Frank squirming around slightly. Annie wore nothing but a silky red bra and panties with white fluff on the waistband. It was the middle of summer, so little clothing would be the most appropriate now. Frank, meanwhile, had on a plain white t-shirt and blue jeans. They each had a glass of champagne in their hands.

Evelyn for one was anxious to get out of the nighttime air and into the air conditioned limo.

“Hey, guys!” Annie cried.

“Supp?” Frank smirked.

“Hey, you guys!” Evelyn eagerly hugged Annie and then Frank. Mason, being less social than his girlfriend simply just waved.

Mason and Evelyn sat down. Evelyn adjusted her long black dress, flatting out the wrinkles. She rocked around on the crinkly sensation beneath her. Taking note of this, Frank mouthed the word, “Diaper?”

Evelyn nodded.

“Where to?” The limousine driver asked.

Frank gave the address.

The limo slowly pulled away from the curb and kept at a nice even pace down the residential area.

“You look nice!” Annie cried, eyeing Evelyn.

“So do you!” Evelyn wailed in excitement.

“And I see Mason is all dressed up in nice sexy blue boxers!” Annie added. Mason nodded. “Still quiet, huh?” Annie giggled.

“You know he’s shy.” Eveyln said.

Annie laughed. “Having grown up across the street from him, yes, yes I do know that, yes!”

“Frank, I still cannot believe you got us a limo!” Eveyln wailed. “Come on, what’s your secret!”

“Rich uncle.” Frank replied simply.

“Ah.” Evelyn said.

“May I ask where you folks are going tonight?” The driver asked from the front.

“A party.” Frank replied.

The drover adjusted his rear view mirror to get a better look at them. “Lookin’ like that?” He asked.

“These are swim suits.” Annie lied.

“Ah.” The driver said. “Pool?”

“Of sorts.” Evelyn giggled.

“Well, just be safe tonight, aright?” The driver said.

“Will do.” Evelyn promised.

“None a my business, but you folks all going together as friends or two separate couples?” The driver wondered.

“Yes and yes.” Annie replied. “Mason and Evelyn here are dating, but Frank and I are both single.”

“We’re all just friends.” Frank explained. “Minus Eveyln and Mason, that is.”

The driver nodded and that ended the conversation. The group still wanted to chat amongst themselves about their growing desperation and the night ahead. But they didn’t want to attract the driver’s attention. Eveyln had thought they were screwed when Annie stated that Mason was in boxers. Frank poured Mason and Evelyn champagne and they all drank and laughed on the way to the event. At long last, the limo pulled over at their destination. Frank cleared up the champagne glasses.

Evelyn turned to Annie. Evelyn pointed at her dress and whispered. “Cleavage?”

Annie pursed her lips. “A little.” She responded.

“Good.” Evelyn pulled down the front of her dress further.

The group climbed out of the limo and made their way to the front door.

“You know, that black dress won’t show any stains too good.” Annie warned Evelyn.

“That’s okay. I don’t plan to wet.” Evelyn replied.

Frank knocked on the door.

“Golden showers?” Annie asked.

Evelyn tilted her head to the side. “We’ll see.”

The mail slot on the ground opened up. “Password?” The man on the other side of the door asked.

Frank bent down and whispered as quietly as he could, “Omorashi lovers.”

A moment later, there was a click, and the door swung open. The man on the other end held the door open just enough for the four to slip inside, then he quickly closed it again.

The music was low. Eveyln didn’t recognize the song. But she did like the soft beat. Of course, music wasn’t really what this party was going for. And they did have to be quite. They didn’t want anyone to hear them.

“Hey, you folks here for the pee party, I assume?” A second man appeared. He wore very tight briefs but that was it. He had lots of muscles on his chest and arms though.

“Yeah.” Evelyn said. “We heard about this on the urine loving site, and here we are!”

“Excellent.” The man said. “My name is Sean, and if you could not tell already, I am the one in charge of this event. I planned it and here it is! A few quick rules. You may pee anywhere you like, do not be afraid. Yes, this is my house, but I will clean up any and all messes after the party. You may wet yourself if you are more comfortable. However, if you are brave enough, you may also aim and or squat on the floor and pee outside your pants. Also, please no messing. This is urine exclusive. Urine is easy to clean up and spreads less bacteria. No messing, please. There is alcohol, please drink responsibly.

Also, you may urinate on others or even have sex with them if given consent! I mean it, CONSENT!” Sean shouted the word in an attempt to get the point across. “If you get consent, go ahead and do any dirty thing you wish. Other than that, please respect people. Also, there is a pool out back. You may go swimming, you may even pee in it. You may even pee outside. Just know, there is a chance someone may see you. If so, I am not held responsible for it. It is late and the neighbors appear to be asleep. This will be a quiet party, so please speak and act calmly whenever possible. We do not want to disturb the neighbors and trust me, we certainly do not want the police coming to stop a party like this!” The group giggled. Sean clapped his hands. “Any questions?”

“Yes,” Eveyln rose her hand. “You said no messing?”

“Mum-hum.” Sean mumbled.

“I am wearing a diaper. Is it okay if I…” Eveyln’s voice trailed off.

Keeping his hands together in front of him, Sean looked to the sky, then back at Evelyn. “How strong is the diaper?”

“Pretty strong. It’s a goodnite.” Evelyn said.

Sean hesitated for a moment, weighing his options. “Okay.” He said. “But I do ask, if it rips or anything, please clean it up yourself.”

“That seems fair.” Evelyn said.

“How many people are coming tonight?” Annie asked.

“Not many.” Sean replied. “Only twenty or so. Any other questions?” Silence. “Well, if there is anything you need, please don’t hesitate to ask.” Sean said. “Please use common sense and have fun! Also, remember, this is a non judgmental zone. Meaning, do not judge others and they will not judge you.”

Mason, Evelyn, Annie, and Frank thanked Sean as he walked off.

The group made their way to the kitchen.

“So, where should we start?” Evelyn asked.

“I don’t know about you guys,” Annie shoved her hands down her panties and began jumping around. “But I have to peeeeeeee!”

Shuffling his feet, Frank added, “Me too.” He desperately squeezed his penis - which bulged through his jeans.

“I wanted to ask on the way, but couldn’t cause of the driver, how desperate are you guys?” Evelyn asked.

“Real desperate!” Annie qhimpered, grabbing herself as tight as she could. “I drank champagne on the way over. And we all know what alcohol does to my bladder!”

“On a scale, I am like a seven.” Frank said.

“I am at least an eight.” Annie said. “I have been holding for a long time. I haven’t peed since noon, all hyped up for this event!”

Evelyn leaned on the counter. “I see, so, you guys don’t want to talk about… waterfalls?” Frank and Annie both let out twin moans. “How about a nice flowing rapid of cool, clear, springtime, water…” Evelyn was careful to enunciate each word.

“What about you?” Annie stood on one foot and kept her hands in fists, wedged down her panties. “You guys desperate?”

“Me? I’m fine. I’m wearing a diaper.” Evelyn started this statement off serious, but by the end of it, she was smiling.

“You, Mason?” Annie asked.

“I’m more into desperation from others.” Mason said. “Not myself.”

“Ah, that’s right!” Annie said.

“Congrats on forming a whole sentence, man.” Frank said.

Grinning, Mason glared at Frank.

“How about we have a little fun?” Evelyn walked between Frank and Annie. Evelyn stood by the kitchen faucet. She grabbed the handle and hesitated for a long moment. Finally, Evelyn turned the faucet on full blast. Water began gushing from the tap down into the sink where it was washed down the drain. Eveyln faced her desperate friends with a sinister smile. “How bad we have to go?” She teased. “Just listen to all that pouring water… Isn’t it nice?”

“No…” Annie uttered. She groaned, squeezing her fists tighter against herself. She moved her knees up and down, one after the other. “Not while you’re desperate.” Annie moaned.

“Just listen to the relaxing sounds of the tap running.” Evelyn teased. “Good, isn’t it?”

“No!” Frank and Annie screamed at once.

“Just listen to the pouring sounds and think about rain drops falling.” Evelyn said. “Think of rivers flowing and geysers gushing. There are so many wet wonderful things on earth! Just think about water parks and fire hydrants and people peeing! So many nice watery things to think about! Think of pouring a nice glass of lemonade or a nice long drink when you are super thirty or even a little trickling stream out in nature. Think about…”

“Oh, oh no! Already!” Annie shouted. Annie had her hands covering her mouth. She stood with her legs widely spread. Annie’s red panties quickly turned maroon as she flooded herself. Several small streams of urine fell through Annie’s undies and to the hardwood kitchen floor.

“You peed already?” Frank demanded.

“I had to go!” Annie shouted. “And now, I broke the steel. I’m gonna be pissin’ all night now! And that is the way I like it! Felt good though…” Annie shoved her hand down her panties and began playing with herself. The constant movement of her underwear caused Annie’s still strong stream to fly in all directions. Annie’s unfinished urine tap sprayed several different streams from her now maroon panties all around. “I’m gonna go play with myself and wait for my bladder to refill. Which should be in like… five minutes." Still peeing, Annie waddled off.

“That just leaves you Frank.” Evelyn marched up to Frank. “Does Frank need to tinkle winkle?” Evelyn asked in a childish voice. She pretended to grab herself. “I have to piss too, Frank, I have to piss too.” Evelyn replied. “But I’m a little baby, so I can just do this…” Evelyn lifted her dress up, showing her crinkly diaper. There was a loud hissing noise and Evelyn’s diaper soon became yellow.

Frank joined in and began flooding his pants. Frank’s jeans quickly began navy and the bottom of his white t-shirt began gray. Frank’s puddle met up with Annie’s to form one large puddle.

“I’m gonna go mingle.” Frank said and walked off in his wet pants.

“That just leaves you and me, babe.” Evelyn said. “I know it isn’t your thing, but this is our chance to meet other urine lovers face to face!” Evelyn felt bad. She is the one who forced Mason to go to this party. But she thought it would be good for both of them! It is easy to talk to someone with your fetish on the computer, but in real life… “I promise, babe,” Evelyn rested a hand on Mason’s shoulder. “I am right here for you. I promise. Just stick by me, okay?” Mason smiled at that. “Frank has the right idea.” Evelyn said. “Let’s go mingle!”

Here is part 2 of this story! Something to know about this story is that every chapter changes POV between the four main chharacters, Mason, Evelyn, Annie, and Frank. This chapter is Frank's point of view! Enjoy

Just as Sean promised, the party was small. But that was okay, great even! It allowed Frank more time to talk with everyone. He got a ton of comments on his already pee soaked pants.

Frank passed a man who turned and laughed. “Pissed yourself all ready, did yeh?” He barked.

Frank came across a woman who smiled and nodded at him. “I hope you don’t think I am being too inappropriate when I say, I like a gu in wet pants!” The lady licked her lips.

Frank passed another guy who smiled at him and stated, “I smell pee. Feel good?”

“Great!” Frank exclaimed. Frank happily strutted through the place with soaking wet pants.

Frank decided to go outside. There was a small table filled with drinks against the wall. A couple of people were helping themselves to some vodka. There were a couple people swimming in the pool, but nothing crazy. Just as Sean asked, everyone was keeping it quiet. Frank decided to go for a dip. He brought a swimsuit, but he left it in his bag. Not wanting to go back inside, Frank simply took off his pee soaked jeans and t-shirt and climbed in the pool in nothing but his boxers.

Frank slowly descended into the pool from the side. The water was freezing. Between the hot night and walking around in warm wet pants, Frank didn’t mind a little coldness. Frank realized too late that the couple already in the pool were in the middle of intimate activities.

Frank saw through the dim light of nighttime, the man had his penis sticking out underwater through the fly of his boxers. The woman was giving the man a slow handjob underwater. It was nothing crazy, just that slow handjob that told Frank her intentions weren’t necessarily to get him off, just have a little naughty fun.

“Oh, sorry,” Frank quickly made to climb out of the water.

“Oh, no, no, no,” the woman said. “Don’t worry, we don’t mind. Just goofing around!”

“Yeah, no worries bro!” The man called.

“I… I didn’t see you guys in the dark.” Frank apologized.

“It’s cool, bro.” The man assured him.

“Yeah, we like public sex. It turns us on a lot!” The woman exclaimed. “Espesally the idea of getting caught, so thanks.”

“Always happy to be apart of someone else’s sexual fantasy.” Frank joked.

The woman laughed while the man just smirked.

“Oh, my name is Marley.” The woman released her man’s penis and extended her hand towards Frank. She quickly pulled it back and offered the other hand. “I assume you want this hand?” She asked.

“Yeah,” Frank chuckled, shaking Marley’s hand. “Frank.”

“Bob.” The man waved, resting both hands on the sides of the pool behind him.

“You enjoying the party?” Marley asked kindly.

“Oh, yeah! So far so good!” Frank exclaimed. “Never been to these things before.”

“Oh no, we go every year!” Marley said.

“They have this every year?” Frank exclaimed.

Marley nodded. “We love it! We can be ourselves and get to know other omorashi lovers. And hey, no waiting on long bathroom lines like at most parties, huh?” Marley playfully moved her elbow towards Frank.

Frank laughed out loud. “Yeah,” he said. “I guess that’s true.”

“Even urine lovers need to connect.” Bob said.

“My friend Evelyn says that it is one thing to talk with a person on a computer, but it is completely different to talk to a person in real life.” Frank said.

“Your friend Evelyn sounds wise.” Marley said.

“I wouldn’t go that far.” Frank said, scratching his armpit. “But in this case, she is right. I talk to omorashi lovers all around the world on a computer! It is actually how I met the friend I came to this party with. Well, actually, my friends Mason and Annie lived across the street from each other as kids, so they already knew each other. But they met me and our other friend Evelyn and now she is dating Mason.”

“Quite the group there, I see.” Marley laughed.

“Yeah,” Frank gently splashed a floating speck in the water away from him. “But anyways, I agree. I knew these guys online for years. As it turns out, they lived right in my home town.”

“Oh, wow.” Marley commented.

“Yeah, but anyways…” Frank’s voice trailed off. Awkward silence fell for a moment. Frank quickly broke it by asking, “So, you two, if you don’t mind my asking, I assume you are together?”

“Oh, yeah. We’ve been married for three years.” Marley wiggled her ring at Frank.

“Very nice! And you are both into omorashi?” Frank asked.

“Yep.” Marley smacked her lips. “I’m into desperation and wetting and he is more into diapers and public urination. But my all time biggest fetish is golden showers! I don’t know what it is, but something about the warmth failing on me…” Marley’s voice trailed off. “I suppose it is dominance.”

“Golden showers are fun.” Frank agreed. He turned to Bob. “My friend Evelyn is also into diapers. She wore one to the party, actually.” Frank said.

“Oh, yeah.” Marley laughed.

“Does she need me to change her?” Bob joked.

“Oh,” Marley pretended to hit him. “I’m the only woman you should be changing!” She giggled. “What are you into?” Marley asked Frank. “No pressure on answering. You can just tell me to shut up, if you want. I’m just curious.”

“No, no, that’s okay.” Frank promised. “I like wetting and humiliation stuff.”

“Ah, I see, I see!” Marley looked to the stars.

“All of this talk about pee…” Bob began.

“Aww, does my baby need to pee?” Marley eagerly moved back and forth in the water. “Go pee!”

“You mind?” Bob asked Frank.

Frank held up a hand. “Not at all.”

A yellow cloud appeared coming from above Bob’s penis - which was still out in open water. The cloud was small and hard to see, especially at night. But Bob was undoubtedly peeing in the water.

“Nice!” Frank exclaimed.

“Good boy.” Marley began moving her hand up and down Bob’s shaft. She began going faster. “You are a good boy, aren’t you?”

Bob sat back, moaning and groaning as his wife gave him an underwater handjob.

Frank felt like he should leave. He didn’t want to intrude on this moment the lovers were having. But thankfully, Marley looked back at him. She began to let up her handjob on Bob. “Sorry, Frank. Almost forgot you were here.” Marley laughed.

“That’s okay.” Frank replied.

“Where is your girlfriend?” Marley asked. “Bring her in and you gentlemen can both get letting handjobs!”

“I don’t have a girlfriend.” Frank said. “Single and ready to mingle!”

The couple laughed.

“Good for you. Don’t be down.” Marley said. “And hey, there are a lot of nice ladies out there. And some of them are even into omorashi!”

“Like this pee loving lady!” Bob said, jabbing a thumb at his wife.

“I do, I do love pee.” Marley agreed. They all laughed at that.

Frank spent another half an hour in the pool, laughing and talking with Bob and Marley.Frank’s hands began to dry into prunes. Eventually, Marley felt the need to relieve herself too.

“Hey, babe, wanna pee in that bush over there?” Bob motioned to a bush by the pool.

“You nuts?” Marley asked with a half-smile.

“Come on! When we first got here, I held my pee because you like it.” Bob pointed out. “I’m into public stuff. You owe me! Besides, we are at a pee party! No one will even care!”

“Fine.” Marley smiled at Frank. “This is a relationship, give and take.” Marele climbed out of the pool and walked a few feet over to the bush. “Can you see me, okay?” She asked.

Bob swam over to the side of the pool. Holding onto the end and kicking his legs behind him like a child, Bob replied, “Perfect! Squat and pee!”

Frank watched as the attractive Marley pulled down her green panties and squatted low to the ground. A strong stream of urine shot from her pussy and created a large puddle on the ground. Just watching her gush, Frank felt a familiar tingle in his bladder which made him cross his legs underwater.

Marley finished up and returned to the water. “How was that?” She asked her husband.

“So sexy!” Bob cried.

“Hey, you guys mind if I pee?” Frank asked.

“Not at all!” Bob exclaimed.

“Join the party!” Marley said.

Not wanting the couple to see his manhood, Frank peed through his boxers. Despite peeing though clothing, an unmistakable odor and yellow cloud came from Frank’s crotch.

“Feel better?” Marley asked.

Frank said, “Much, thank you.”
