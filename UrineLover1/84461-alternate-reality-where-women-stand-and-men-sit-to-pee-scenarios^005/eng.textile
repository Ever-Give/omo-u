Story number six in this series:

Vanessa and Julia sat in Julia’s van. Vanessa fiddled with the radio stations as Julia chugged down an entire cup of soda.

“Be careful,” Vanessa warned, her eyes glued to the radio. “There are always super long lines for the bathroom at these things.”

Julia took a deep breath of air, after having her mouth on the straw of her soda for so long. “That’s only for the men’s room,” Julia said. “Besides, worse comes to worse, we can just sneak behind the building and pee.”

“Yeah, but this is also a trilogy showing,” Vanessa added. “We are watching Back to the Future parts one through three. This is a six-hour drive-in movie!”

“Yeah, but there are intermissions between each film,” Julia replied. “And again, we can just go behind the bathrooms and pee.”

“I still don’t think you should inhale your soda like that,” Vanessa muttered.

“Will you relax! Damn, you sound like my dad,” Julia grunted. She sucked down several more big gulps of soda. “‘Don’t drink too much, Julia!’ ‘Put down the toilet seat, Julia!’” Julia said in a mocking voice to her father. “I tell you, Nessa, I love that man!” Julia sucked down more soda. “But he could be a pain in the ass at times.”

“Oh, and I am sure you weren’t!”

“Nope! I was his favorite child!”

“Mumph…” There was a pause and then Vanessa grunted. “I wish I could figure this out!”

“Here, let me see,” Julia tampered with the dials and suddenly, the noise that vented out of the radio was of a preview for the upcoming movie featured on the giant fifty-foot-tall screen.

“How’d you do that?” Vanessa demanded.

Leaning back with her soda, Julia simply said, “I was paying attention when they said what station it was on.” Upon seeing the look on Venessa’s face, Julia snorted out some soda.

In no time, the previews ended, and the opening credits came on the screen.

“Here we go,” Vanessa eagerly rubbed her hands together.

Julia scooped up a fistful of salty popcorn. “Back to the Future: Part 1, here we come!”

As the film slowly started, Vanessa and Julia were unable to resist thinking of their love for this franchise and how it started their friendship. When these two women were eight years old, their parents took them to a Back to the Future convention where they heard director Robert Zemeckis speak on the films. There, Vanessa and Julia meet, and they become great friends. They even learned they lived in the same town. Their love for these movies has kept them connected over the past twenty-two years.

Naturally, when they heard about the Back to the Future trilogy being played in the drive-in movies, they bought their tickets instantly. Vanessa and Julia have seen all three films hundreds of times over the years. They have played through the video game dozens of times and have even built a ton of Lego sets. They knew every line to each film by heart. And they had mountains of merchandise from this trilogy. To say these two thirty-year-old women were huge Back to the Future fans was a serious understatement. Julia’s van was even decorated with stickers from the movies and sitting on the dashboard was a miniature hoverboard from the films. Vanessa and Julia both wore Back to the Future themed t-shirts, and the powered lace shoes and tie-dyed hats from the second movie. The dashboard was also decorated with Pop Back to the Future figurines surrounding the hoverboard.

Just watching Michael J. Fox (Marty McFly) enter Christopher Lloyd (Doctor Emmett Brown)’s garage had the two women jumping in their seats.

The two women stared intently at the screen, their eyes never breaking away even once. Completely unaware to either woman, was how quickly Julia’s kidneys were filtering her soda. Julia’s bladder began to fill, and Julia got a small urge to pee around a quarter way into the first film. But the urge was so small, she barely even noticed. The urge got a lot more noticeable, however, about halfway into the film. But Julia’s love of this trilogy was so strong, she was still able to easily ignore the signals her bladder was sending to her brain.

On screen, Marty was busy, sitting in the café, writing thirty-year-old Doc Brown a letter, warning him of his death in the future. This was one of Julia’s all-time favorite Back to the Future scenes! Ironically, this was also the scene where the urge to pee got extra bad. Julia had to cross her legs behind the steering wheel.

Vanessa took note of her friend’s movements, but she decided to pass it up. Vanessa was too engaged in this film she has seen hundreds of times to care much about her friend’s rapidly filling bladder.

Soon it was the scene of the clock tower. Doc hung from the building, attempting to plug the cables back in. Meanwhile, Marty shot down the road like a rocket, ready to make his grand escape back to the year 1985.

At this point, Julia knew there was no point in denying it. She had to pee… Wow, did she have to pee! Julia grasped her genitals and rocked in her seat. Why did she drink all that soda? Julia seriously wished she had listened to Vanessa right about now. (She would never admit that out loud though). Julia had what felt like gallons of liquid waste on her bladder, begging to be released. Julia could feel bubbles inside her bladder. Waves rolled around and her entire bladder lunged from side to side, along with Julia’s legs. Julia sat behind the wheel, her legs to her chest, her hands in her crotch. Julia felt ready to explode! But she would be damned if she missed even one second of this film. She could hold it! The first movie was almost done and then there would be a ten-minute intermission. She just had to focus on the movie.

But even Julia’s love for this franchise was no longer enough to distract her. That is how Julia knew her urge to pee was serious. Not even Back to the Future was enough to distract her from her bodily needs!

Julia never thought she would say this about Back to the Future… But the rest of the first film seemed to drag on. At long last, the famous words, ‘To Be Continued…’ flashed on the screen and the DeLorean shot into the sky and vanished in a flash of light. The screen then changed to a candy bar, popcorn bucket, and soda cup marching along.

Vanessa turned to her squirming friend and grinned. “Drink too much soda?”

“Mumph…” Julia grunted, squeezing her legs to her crotch.

“Need to pee?”

“Mumph!” Julia said urgently, squeezing her vulva and trembling.

“Go pee,” Vanessa laughed.

Julia threw open the door and stepped out into brisk summer night. “You coming?” Julia panted from the effort to hold back that entire half a liter of soda.

“All good,” Vanessa took a small sip of soda. “I peed before we left!” Vanessa said proudly. “I also watched my fluid intake, Julia!” Vanessa snorted on the other woman’s name.

Julia just rolled her eyes.

“Grab me some more popcorn while you’re out there,” Vanessa asked.

Julia flipped her friend off, then slammed the car door. Julia turned, and galloped off towards the restrooms.

Julia and Vanessa were parked near the end of the lot. This gave them a much better view of the screen and they didn’t have to hold their heads down as much to get a good look. This also meant that it was a very short hike to the bathroom.

But alas, Vanessa was correct. A relatively long line trailed out the door of the ladies’ room. At least it wasn’t nearly as bad as the men’s room! Between stalls taking up more space and men taking longer in general to pee, a very long line of nearly one hundred men came from the men’s room’s doors. At least the line to the women’s room was usually pretty quick.

But Julia could not wait! Her bladder was imploring her to just void. Plus, Julia feared missing the beginning of part two of the trilogy. Thankfully, just as she told Vanessa, Julia was a woman. She could just go behind the bathroom building and pee. And so, Julia, hands in crotch, skipped with her full bladder to behind the building. But an awful sight met her there…

Two police officers, acting as security guards, were standing behind the building. Julia had a feeling they were placed here specifically to catch any woman in the act of alleviating her needs. It was not uncommon for women at rock concerts or music festivals or carnivals or drive-in movies to go behind a building and take aim. No wonder the people here were skeptical and (quite literally) on guard. Julia silently cursed. She needed to pee! And these two police officers kept her from that.

Julia reluctantly slipped back to the front of the building and took her place in the long ladies’ bathroom line. Worse yet, having spent that extra time going behind the building, the line was even longer than it was a minute ago. At least the line was indeed moving quickly. Julia would get her relief in no time! She hoped anyway…

Julia knew she would be fine in terms of holding for a few more minutes. The question was, would she manage to get in, pee, and get back to the car before Back to the Future: Part 2 started playing?

Julia glanced over at the long men’s bathroom line. Julia felt incredibly sorry for those men. She knew firsthand how much it sucked to have a full bladder. But she was more focused on her own desperate needs at the moment.

The ladies’ bathroom line had shrunk tremendously in the past several minutes. Julia was nearing the front. She could feel relief extra close now. Only a few more women and she would be at the front. So close… Julia’s overfilled bladder quacked with anticipation to let out all the soda. Julia could practically see the urinal trough through the bathroom doors. That’s when Julia heard a car honk behind her.

Dancing in place, Julia turned. She spotted Vanessa hanging over the wheel of her van, honking and honking to get her attention. Julia instantly picked up on what she was trying to say.

The second film had begun to play on the screen. Julia glanced over her shoulder at the restroom. She looked back at the screen. She looked at the restroom, the screen, the restroom, the screen, weighing her options. Julia’s bladder begged for relief, but her Back to the Future heart begged to get back to the car and listen to the second film. Julia cursed, knowing what she had to do.

Julia wished the bathroom goodbye, throwing away her chance of relief, and waddled back to the car.

“Hey, did you get my popcorn?” Vanessa asked.

“No,” Julia grunted, slamming the door shut. Julia placed her feet up on the seat with her and hugged them tight. “I didn’t get your popcorn and I didn’t get a chance to pee!”

“That sucks,” Vanessa said, eating a fist full of Reses Pieces. “You gonna be able to hold it?”

Julia glanced over at Vanessa as if she had just suggested the sky was falling. “Of course!” Julia cried. “How old do you think I am?”

“Okay,” Vanessa shook her nearly empty box of candy.

Julia laced her hands through her twitching legs. “Trust me, I just won’t think about it, and I’ll be fine!” Julia’s eyes expanded to ping pong balls. She had nearly forgotten that the opening of Back to the Future: Part 2… Was a downpour.

Julia watched in terror as she saw hundreds of heavy, large droplets of water splatter all over the windshield of the DeLorean. The sound that came from the radio was that of a torrential storm. Julia’s bladder shook vigorously. Her sphincter muscle ached. Sweat dripped down her skin.

“Uh-huh, and how’s ‘not thinking about it’ working out for you?” Vanessa teased.

“Oh, shut up,” Julia hissed through her tight lips.

Julia begged this rotten scene to end soon! She was silently relieved when she heard the voices of Doc and Marty. Due to the characters speaking, the sound of the storm was less noisy. But Julia still saw a heavy rainfall and heard it faintly in the background as well.

Julia had never realized how much water was in the second Back to the Future film. The storm at the beginning, Marty crashing into the lake, Biff and the girls in the hot tub… Julia’s bladder was throbbing erratically. There was far too much pee inside for Julia to hold. Julia suddenly got an idea! How did she not think about it before!

Julia grabbed her empty soda cup, threw the top open, undid her jeans, held the cup in front of her open fly, and peed as hard as she could. The sound of urine pounded against the plastic cup. The strong piss scent grew through the parked vehicle.

The relief was remarkable! Truthfully, Julia could have held it longer, but when you have a cup and the ability to pee standing, you don’t need to! And either way, Julia felt tremendous to get even a little pressure off of her raging full bladder. Just feeling her internal water level decrease was an extraordinary feeling. How Julia wished this hot piss could last an eternity!

“What are you doing!” Vanessa wailed.

“Peeing!” Julia snapped.

“Julia, that is…”

“Just watch the damn film!”

And so the two women turned back to the screen, pretending that Julia was not using an empty soda cup as a makeshift bathroom.

Julia hated to break her eyes away from the screen for even a moment, but she forced herself to, and spotted the deep yellow liquid had now nearly reached the top of the cup. Julia cursed wildly under her breath. With some difficulty, she managed to shut off her delightful flow. Julia carefully maneuvered the overflowing cup of liquid emission into a cup holder. Julia zipped up her pants and stated, “I still have to pee…”

“HOW!” Vanessa wailed, examining the full half a liter cup of her friend’s urine. “You pissed half a liter… How full was your bladder?”

“Full,” Julia crossed her legs. She felt a lot better at having gotten that much off of her bladder. Julia could easily make it through the rest of this film. Maybe even the third.

The second film drew to a close.

“Time to try again,” Julia said, stepping out of the car. “Wish me luck.”

“Good luck,” Vanessa waved goodbye. “Don’t forget my pop…” But Julia ‘accidently’ closed the door before Vanessa could finish.

Julia sprinted back towards the bathrooms. After filling up her soda cup, Julia was now somewhere in between a mild and desperate need to micturate. But she would love to get the rest out! And she still had to hurry because A) she didn’t want to miss the third movie. And B) if the last intermission taught her anything… The lines form quickly.

Unfortunately for Julia’s semi-full bladder, there was a short line for the ladies’. But it was much smaller than before. Julia made it just as several other women began to line up behind her. Many of them were on their cell phones or chatting with one another. Julia did catch a couple of desperate women dancing in the line. But for the most part, they all had mild urges.

Julia overheard the women behind her disgusting how no one was allowed to go behind the bathrooms and pee. The police were stationed there to stop them. Julia heard one of the women joke that the police were probably men, jealous that they too, couldn’t pee wherever they wanted.

Julia was finally at the front of the line. And checking her cell phone, there was still five minutes left of intermission! Julia would make it easy!

Just as a woman exited the bathroom, a couple of park workers came out as well.

“Sorry, folks,” one of them said. “This bathroom is closed until further notice.”

The line of women groaned.

“Sorry,” said the other worker. “This bathroom is disgusting. Needs to be cleaned.”

“It’s the women’s room!” Julia roared, motioning to the open door. “It’s always messy!”

“Well, we had a toilet overflow and there is fecal matter everywhere,” one worker said. “Add that to the urine and bloody tampons everywhere, this restroom needs to be cleaned stat! You can try again in an hour.”

Groaning, the line of women slowly dispersed. And so did Julia.

Julia re-entered the van with Vanessa on her phone.

“You’re back early,” Vanessa said, taking her gaze from the glowing screen in her palms. “I take it you were able to pee?”

“Not exactly,” Julia explained how the bathroom was shut down for cleaning.

Vanessa scoffed. “Seems kind of cruel to do that in the middle of a showing.”

“Yeah,” Julia crossed her legs. “But I already let quite a bit out.”

“Tell me about it,” Vanessa eyed Julia’s cup which she, Vanessa had carefully placed the lid back on.

“I’ll be fine,” Julia said. “They said the bathroom would open back up in an hour. So, I can try peeing before we leave.”

“Think you can make it until we get back home?”

“That’ll be pushing it!”

Julia lived half an hour away. And having to also drop off Vanessa, it would be a forty-five minute drive back home. Julia may last two more hours, but three would take a bit of luck.

“You ever wonder if the men’s room is disgusting like the ladies’ room?” Julia asked.

Staring down at her phone, Vanessa scratched her nose. “I’m sure it is. My brother told me how men are always squatting above the dirty toilet seat out of fear of getting germs. They sometimes miss and pee gets all over. Women and men are both messy. Just in very different ways.”

Julia nodded in agreement.

The third film started. Vanessa put her cell phone away. And the two women reengaged in the jumbo-sized screen.

Vanessa and Julia both had a preference for the third film. While they loved the entire series, the third film had always been their favorite. They were most excited to see this one play on the big screen.

Julia was doing fine for most of the film. But upon seeing Doc Brown in the saloon, watching all of the drinks on screen, reawakened a need inside Julia. The tiny shot glasses of liquor appeared to be the size of large water bottles on the large screen. Julia couldn’t help but imagine how badly one would need to take a leak, should they drink all of that alcohol.

Julia tightly crossed her legs and let a small moan escape her sealed lips.

Julia knew that the bathroom would have been all cleaned up at this point. It had been well over an hour. The bathroom was surely open to the public again. But once again, Julia would be damned if she missed a single moment from any of the three films. Especially now that the third film - the best film - was nearing the thrilling climax!

The film carried on and Julia carried on holding. Julia was well aware that her bladder had quickly filled all the way back up. All of that soda she drank was enough to fill her bladder at least twice in a span of six hours. Julia was just happy she had gotten a lot out into the cup. If not, her bladder would have quite possibly burst with no more room for any more liquid.

Julia was now wishing she could travel back in time just like Marty and Doc. If she could, Julia’s first assignment would be to stop herself from drinking all of that soda a few hours ago!

The entire train scene was difficult to sit through. Not because there were any liquids, but due to all of the action. Normally, the action was Julia’s favorite part! But when her bladder was pulsating inside her pelvic floor, watching the characters’ heroic, daring movements caused Julia’s bladder to pound, at war with her sphincter. And when the train fell off the tracks and exploded, Julia felt her bladder jolt, threatening to spill all of its contents.

The third film soon ended, and the two women cheered.

“I’m gonna pee!” Julia wailed, anxious to get to the bathroom before the line started.

“I need to go too,” Vanessa responded.

And so the two women made their way out of the car and to the restroom.

Between being so quick and the films being over - so most people just went home - the line only had three people in front of them.

Holding in line wasn’t too painful. Again, the line moved quickly - which is more than could be said about the men’s room. The only thing was, Julia was diffidently at a point where she had to dance and squirm around. It was kind of embarrassing to have to touch herself and move her legs so much… But having a public accident would be even more embarrassing!

Vanessa just laughed at Julia the whole time.

Finally, Julia made it into the restroom. Julia pushed past another woman who left. This meant Vanessa was allowed in as well.

Julia rushed up to the urinal trough, standing next to a very tall woman. Julia unbuttoned and unzipped her pants. She moved her thong to the side and held her vaginal lips, took aim, and fired a steamy golden stream directly onto the pile of ice cubes at the bottom of the trough. Julia sighed in solace. She was so happy to finally get to see her urine stream burst forth from her genitals and melt the ice, turning it into yellow mush. Julia’s pee was so humid, that she had no issues understanding how it could cut through the cold ice with ease.

Vanessa took her place between Julia and another woman. Vanessa also unzipped, undid her belt, and peed.

A couple women at the end of the trough were chatting, but other than that, the restroom was nearly silent. Apart from the splatting of urine on ice that is.

“Hey, anyone know why they put ice in troughs?” Vanessa asked.

“It helps wash the urine down the drain and helps with the smell,” the woman on the other side of Julia said.

Vanessa nodded.

The woman besides Julia bent down carefully to scratch her leg, carefully to keep her vaginal lips pointed at the trough.

One by one, the women silenced their streams, zipped, rearranged, washed their hands (sometimes) and exited.

Vanessa soon finished. She clapped Julia on the back and went to wash her hands.

“See you back at the car,” Julia called.

“Oh, you want me to wait for you?” Vanessa asked.

“No, that’s alright.”

“You sure?”

Julia snorted. “I’m a big girl, I can handle being in a public bathroom by myself, thank you.”

Folding her arms, Vanessa leaned back against the wall. “Well, you weren’t responsible enough to refrain from drinking all that soda.”

Julia fired a nasty look behind her shoulder at her comrade. Smirking, Vanessa exitted. Julia’s stream took another couple minutes. When her bladder was gruntled, she zipped and washed her hands under the freezing faucet, and followed Vanessa out.

Back on the freeway, heading home, the two women laughed and discussed the films they had seen so many times, but never projected on such a large screen.

Once back at Vanessa’s house, the two said goodbye.

“Oh, and Julia,” Vanessa said, standing at the door of Julia’s van.

“Yeah?”

Vanessa eyed the cup of now cold urine sitting sandwiched in between the seats. “Make sure you dump out that whiz in the toilet,” Vanessa instructed.

Julia just smiled. “Toilets? Where we’re going, we don’t need… Toilets.”

The next story in this series:

Summer awoke from her tent. The morning sun was blazing down on this fine summer day. The air was crisp, and the birds chirped up in the trees. The grass glittered from morning dew and swayed in the breeze as if it were at a rock concert. Peaceful mornings like this were a reminder to Summer how gorgeous the natural world was. Hence why Summer loves coming up here every year. Camping outdoors for a week all alone? What could be better!

As Summer crawled from the mouth of her tent, she felt herself weighed down by the pressure of an unemptied morning bladder. Summer’s first step, before anything else, would be to find a nice spot to relieve her filled pee sack.

As Summer emerged into the summertime forest, she heard a strange noise. The noise resembled chewing and even slight barking here and there. Summer turned and nearly emptied her bladder where she stood. Standing across from Summer, gobbling up all of her food… Was three large gray wolves.

How could Summer have been so foolish? She should have stored her food before going to bed last night. But she hadn’t thought of it. This was why there were so many rules for camping or hiking in nature! Like store your food or don’t urinate/defecate too close to the trail. Wait a moment… That was it! Wild predators like wolves were attracted to urine. Summer had an idea!

Fortunately, wolves have an excellent sense of smell. But knowing that she could not waste one single drop of urine, Summer knew she had to spread her urine around as much of the faraway forest as possible.

Summer ventured into the woods and hiked down a few dozen meters. Once satisfied, Summer faced her campsite, just barely able to make out her tent in the clearing. Summer then unzipped her jeans, pulled her underwear aside, and took an intense morning release. Morning pee splattered on the forest floor, sending up dozens of tiny droplets, rebounding off of the hard earth. Summer’s pee hissed off the grass and it glittered in the sun. But Summer did not stop there.

Summer began walking backwards, allowing her stream to follow behind. Summer was careful not to trip over any roots or rocks. She kept walking, allowing her stream to slowly trail behind her.

At one point, Summer found herself backed up against a cliff wall. So, Summer aimed her stream directly below her legs. She then spread her legs as far as they would go, and she waddled forward, allowing her stream to fly forward and then land in between her feet. Summer waddled until she made it around the cliffside. She then continued walking backwards, aiming her stream behind her.

After journeying for over half a mile, Summer’s stream finally lost power and began trickling from in between her jeans. It wasn’t for several more meters until her stream stopped completely.

Summer shook and zipped. Summer then retracted her steps, following her glittering pee trail. Summer’s urine sparkled off of the grass, it left a dark brown trail in the dirt, it left streaks over a few rocks she had passed.

Summer managed to find her way back to her campsite. And sure enough, the wolves were gone. Having been lured away by the scent of fresh urine, Summer now had her campsite all back to herself.

Urine truly is amazing! Even creatures in the natural world love it!

This is the final story in this series. Enjoy!

Victoria and Naomi went charging into the ladies’ room, giggling hysterically.

The ladies’ room was nearly empty. There was just one woman standing at the middle urinal with her pants down. The woman’s pee stream was incredibly loud. It sounded like thunder as her monstrous stream touched down on the urinal water.

The two homosexual women dashed behind the back of the urinating lady, and rushed into the nearest stall, unintentionally slamming the door closed.

The woman at the urinal jumped at the loud noise. She then shook it off, scratched her nose with her fist, and continued peeing.

“Do you think she saw us?” Naomi whispered.

“Who cares, I have to pee!” Victoria grasped her crotch and began doing a little potty dance, jumping from foot to foot.

Giggling, Naomi stripped her shirt off and tossed it to the ground. Naomi’s perky breasts were now exposed, jutting slightly from her watermelon-colored bra. Naomi ran her hands over her soft titties and grinned up at her girlfriend. Naomi was a noticeable foot shorter than Victoria. But she kind of liked being the little one. Naomi was naturally more submissive anyway. And this worked out well given her girlfriend’s dominant personality!

Victoria, still grasping her crotch, threw an arm around her girlfriend’s neck and began making out with her.

The two women kissed and kissed. They held their vulvas tight through their clothes as they made out. The two girlfriends had put off going to the bathroom just for this occasion. And now that they were in arm’s reach of a toilet, it suddenly hit them just how badly their bladders wanted a release.

Victoria and Naomi kissed longer enough to hear the urinal flush three times. They felt so naughty! Making out in a public ladies’ room during the day! They were each getting hornier and hornier the more they thought of it. Likewise, their bladders were getting fuller and fuller. Both women currently were in the position of two clitorises and two bladders that all craved attention.

As they made out, Victoria bent down so her girlfriend could strip off her t-shirt. Naomi - not taking her lips off of her girlfriend’s - undid Victoria’s belt and yanked it off. She then slid down Victoria’s lime colored panties and began kissing her labia which slipped out the sides of the tight fabric.

Victoria bite her lip to keep from moaning. The very sensation of her girlfriend gently kissing her sensitive lips was enough to make Victoria temporarily lose control.

A quick hissing was heard by Naomi’s cheek. Naomi looked up in alarm, just in time to watch her girlfriend’s lime-colored panties turn dark green underneath the crotch.

“Are we leaking?” Naomi teased, starting up at her girlfriend’s aroused face. “Huh? You went leaky?” Naomi felt around and placed two fingers above her girlfriend’s clit. She gently pressed down, applying the slightest pressure to it. Naomi pressed down on her girlfriend’s clit through her wet panties. She began wiggling the fabric around. Noami could feel Victoria’s clitoris getting fatter as it swelled with the blood of arousal.

Victoria moaned, feeling ready to leak again.

Naomi stood and allowed her girlfriend to undress her. Soon, both women stood in nothing but bras and panties.

Victoria adjusted her black bra. “A little help?” Victoria spun around and allowed Naomi access to undo the clip of her bra. Victoria's bra slid to the floor. Victoria spun around, allowing her DD-cup breasts access to flop around. Victoria undid her girlfriend’s watermelon bra. Naomi’s breasts were much smaller than Victoria’s. Naomi was only a B-cup. Victoria always insisted that she liked small boobs. Naomi chose to believe her. Victoria slid Naomi’s white and black checkered underpants to the floor and Naomi did the same for Victoria’s lime colored ones.

Victoria and Naomi gathered up their clothing and placed it carefully onto the hook in the stall. This way it wouldn’t get wet… Hopefully!

Victoria ran a gentle hand through Naomi’s small bush of pubic hair. Naomi only trimmed her pubes, she didn’t shave. Victoria on the other hand was clean shaven. Not a scrap of pubic hair anywhere on Victoria’s pelvis.

“Babe,” Naomi moaned. Naomi placed a hand under her legs and squeezed and squeezed. “I have to pee…” Naomi moaned, bending down inside the tight stall.

“I know, babe, I’m bursting full myself!” Victoria hopped from foot to foot. Victoria finally remained still and began moving her fingers slowly across her labia. “Ready to tinkle?”

“Yeah, yeah…” Squirming, Naomi stood as far against the wall as she could.

Naomi used her fingers to pull her labia up. Victoria did the same. Both women took aim and fired at the exact same time.

Two identical pee streams soared through the air. Each one connected with the skin of her partner.

Naomi fired a warm golden stream all over Victoria’s stomach. Victoria sent her stream down, soaking her partner’s leg. Naomi migrated her stream north and soaked Victoria's large breasts in her liquid waste. Naomi covered Victoria’s areola as well. Victoria moved her stream to cover Naomi’s bubblegum colored, hanging vaginal lips. Naomi sent her stream over Victoria’s face. Victoria closed her eyes and spit out a little urine that ended up in her mouth. The urine and spit landed perfectly on Naomi’s neck. Naomi peed straight into Victoria’s ear canal. Victoria peed into Naomi’s pierced belly button. Naomi blasted her piss stream straight onto Victoria’s nose. Victoria closed her eyes and shook her head, a smirk implanted on her tended facial muscles. Victoria volleyed her whiz onto her significant other’s feet and moved the stream onto each individual toe.

The two women stood in the stall, as quiet as could be, silently dousing each other in their warm bladder contents. The bathroom floor was now covered in urine. The two homosexual women stood in the stuff, smiling at one another.

The two women quickly wrapped their arms around each other and resumed making out. They ran their hands all over their partner’s piss soaked skin, and moaned with delight, relishing this naughty moment!

Before they knew it, Naomi lay in the piss puddle and Victoria lay on top of her. Victoria began lightly nibbling on her partner’s nipples. Naomi had to shove a fist into her mouth to keep from screaming in the public setting. Victoria lapped her tongue over Naomi’s unusually large teats.

Naomi, meanwhile, gently brushed her wet leg over Victoria’s hip. Naomi lightly dug her big toe up Victoria’s wrinkled brown labia and she placed her big toe directly into her partner’s vagina. Victoria opened her mouth to yelp, but before she had the chance, Naomi lifted herself off the ground and kissed her girlfriend lovingly and passionately on the lips.

Victoria lowered herself onto her girlfriend and began running her hands over Naomi’s small, yet perky breasts. Naomi placed a thumb over Victoria’s left nipple and began pushing it around from side to side. Victoria bit her lip so hard she drew some blood. Noami ran her hands over Victoria’s shoulders and lightly tugged at her hair. Victoria squeezed Noami’s ears and pushed her body farther down on top of her.

Namoi ran her hands along Victoria’s backside, feeling her thick and soft ass. Victoria buried her face between Naomi’s breasts and began to push her head around. To keep from screaming, Namoi bit her own lip and slapped the floor, sending up a small trail of urine which splashed Victoria in her thick blonde hair, causing the hair to plaster down and become more delicate.

Victoria lowered her hand and began fiddling around with Naomi’s clitoris. Naomi’s mouth shot open, but no sound escaped. Naomi lifted her arms and grasped the rim of the toilet behind her. Dispiet laying on the ground, holding onto the toilet gave the small woman some support. Victoria continued lightly tugging on, fingering, spitting on, and pushing around Naomi’s clit. With her free hand, Victoria ran her fingers through Naomi’s bush. A few loose strands of curly black pubic hair came off and covered Victoria’s hand.

Naomi removed a single hand from the toilet. Victoria, knowing what Naomi wanted, eagerly lifted herself farther off the ground. Naomi placed a hand on Victoria’s clit and began fingering with all her strength. The two women chewed their lips as they played with each other’s clitoris.

After several moments of foreplay, Naomi lay flat on the ground and spread her legs. Naomi’s back was flat against the, now cold, puddle of pee. Victoria also spread her legs. Victoria carefully maneuvered herself so that her pussy was directly on top of Naomi’s. Victoria began to grind up and down. Naomi chewed her lip harder than she ever has. Her eyes remained closed as this glorious feeling carried on. And the sound of urination told these two that they were not alone. And that was what made it even sexier!

Sarah stood before the center urinal, the fly of her jeans open, and her stream shooting down.

Cassie entered and approached the far urinal, the one closest to the stalls. Cassie nodded to her bathroom companion. “Hey.”

“Hey,” Sarah nodded back.

Cassie faced the urinal and unzipped her jeans. Cassie hopped up and down to allow her vaginal lips to come through the fly. Cassie held her lips, took aim, and peed directly into the urinal water.

“Whew,” Cassie breathed, planting her hand on the wall in front of her. “Hey,” Cassie turned to Sarah. “I like your nails.”

“First off, please don’t look,” Sarah giggled, knowing the only way Cassie would have seen her nails is if she looked at her business. “And secondly, thank you! My boyfriend did them.”

“He has talent…” Cassie was cut off by the sound of a bang! The bathroom stall next to Cassie rattled on its hinges. The two urinal ladies faced each other.

They stopped their streams prematurely, zipped up and walked towards the door of the stall.

“Oh, yeah…” Victoria moaned.

“Quiet, you,” Naomi giggled.

The shadow of the closed stall door slowly drifted away. Victoria and Naomi slowly looked up, still in their favorite scissoring position. Standing before them were two shocked women.

Silence fell. No one made a sound or a movement. The four women just stared at one another.

“I… I thought you locked the door…” Naomi’s voice came out weak.

“I thought you locked it…” Victoria said.

Naomi and Victoria glared at one another. They then smiled awkwardly up at the two women who had been unlucky enough to catch them.

Sarah and Cassie just stared down, their jaws on the pee covered floor, their eyes as wide as ping pong balls, as they stared and stared at the two naked lesbian ladies, they had caught on a pee coated floor in the midst of sexual intercourse.

“Umm… Hi…” Naomi managed. Victoria elbowed her. Naomi shrugged, not knowing what else to say.

“Gross,” Sarah said and slammed the door shut.

Victoria and Naomi were lucky enough that those two women in the bathroom hadn’t called the police. Or even the restaurant manager for that matter. Victoria and Naomi went home that night, unable to feel excited. Sure, they had been caught, but they had the time of their lives before that! And even the thrill of finally getting caught was enough to arouse them both.

As soon as they stepped in the door, Naomi began running her hands over her girlfriend’s large knockers and began kissing her fruity lips. Victoria ran her fist through her GF’s lovely black hair.

“What do you say we finish what we started?” Naomi suggested.

“I love that idea!” Victoria kissed her hard. “But babe…”

“Yeah…” Naomi leaned in, anxious to hear what her lover had to say.

Victoria just smiled, brushed Naomi’s shoulders, and stated, “I have to pee.”

I decided to do a few more stories. Here is the next installment. Enjoy! 🙂

Sasha grasped her womanhood and held tight. Sasha could see her bladder bulging from her muscular caramel colored skin. Given how hot it was outside today, Sasha wore a black D-cup bra which stretched to make room for her large breasts.

Sasha had to take a break from running. It hurt to even move, let alone run. Sasha squeezed herself through her dark jeans. Her lower half was sweltering, making her regret wearing long pants today.

Sasha quietly whispered to herself, “I’m a big girl, I can make it… Come on, Sash, you are a champion… You are a body builder… You can hold your pee… Just like lifting weights, you can hold the pressure in…” This helped the caramel-colored woman calm down a bit. Sasha felt the pressure go down ever so slightly. She was relieved no one was around to hear her monologue to herself. Thank god the park was empty today!

After regaining control of herself, Sasha continued to the toilets.

She was appalled and horrified, however, when she saw the ‘Out of Order’ sign plastered over the door to the ladies’ room.

Fear crept over Sasha. She knew she could not wait. The men’s room, perhaps? But no. The men’s room had a ‘closed for cleaning’ sign on it. Sasha cursed under her breath. She could not wait. No one was around. In fact, Sasha had not seen anyone at the park all day today. Plus, that morning coffee and all the water she added to her body throughout the day would not wait much longer.

Sasha was a buddy builder. Hydration was very important to her. She had seven bottles of water since this morning, and they were making her bladder begin to cave in.

Sasha turned and sped into the nearby bushes. She looked left, then right, and left again, just to confirm that she was indeed alone. She was. Sasha quickly began fumbling with the buckle of her navy jeans. Sasha spit out a string of curse words as she struggled to undo the button.

Her face was oozing with sweat. Sasha’s dark sunglasses were sliding down her nose, which was a slip n’ slide of perspiration. She even had beads of sweat dotting her black lipstick-colored lips. Sasha was used to sweating. Especially on hot days. But this was a different kind of sweat. It wasn’t from the heat or from working out. It was the type of sweat that came with a full bladder.

Sasha's jeans finally came undone. Hiding behind the bush, Sasha yanked the flaps of her jeans to the side and let a clear river - the perfect symbol of good hydration - gush from her labia onto the floor of the park. Sasha’s lips formed an O as she breathed a quiet sigh of relief.

Sasha closed her eyes behind her sunglasses, not caring who saw, just enjoying the feeling as the pressure in her bladder went down. She enjoyed the pitter patter sound her urine stream made as it connected with the dirt. She enjoyed the gentle breeze rustling through her curly black hair, pulled into a ponytail.

Sasha closed her eyes behind her sunglasses, not caring who saw, just enjoying the feeling as the pressure in her bladder went down. She enjoyed the pitter patter sound her urine stream made as it connected with the dirt. She enjoyed the gentle breeze rustling through her curly black hair, pulled into a ponytail.

Sasha heard a noise that made her eyes spring open. Standing beside her was a woman with olive colored skin with long chocolate colored hair that had a cowlick standing far up in the air. She wore azure lipstick and fishnet stockings with long black boots, a dark blue skirt and a belt that was crooked on her waist, and a translucent top that showed off her mountain sized breasts. Her nipples, however, were hidden from view behind a strange garment that Sasha had never seen before.

Something was off about the woman. She was standing on one leg, keeping the other pressed against her knee. She chewed her lip and her face was red. She looked really stressed out. In one hand she held her cell phone and allowed her other hand to hang at her side, limply holding a cigarette. Sasha noticed the bracelet around her wrist and the white collar around her neck. Sasha had a feeling she understood this woman’s problem.

“Have to pee?” Sasha asked.

The newcomer shifted her head in a weak nod.

“I won’t look,” Sasha turned away. It was hard not to though. This busty woman was very hot.

The woman placed her cigarette back in her mouth and held her phone in between her breasts. Sasha wished her breasts could do that! And she thought her D-cup was big! This woman must have been a triple D at least!

The woman undid her belt and pulled her skirt down slightly. She moaned loudly as a stream, much darker than Sasha’s, burst from her lips.

“Feel better?” Sasha asked.

“Whew!” The woman breathed. “Those damn bathrooms! Out of order! Thought I was gonna burst! I’m Mandy, by the way.”

“Sasha.” The pair shook hands. They then peed in silence.

After she finished, Sasha rebuckled her hands, happy to see her bladder bulge had disappeared. Sasha was also overjoyed that she didn’t get caught. Well, she did. But she was caught by another woman who was dying to pee. What luck!
