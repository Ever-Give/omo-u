Godly Desperation

Hey everyone! Thank you all so, so much for the feedback and the wonderful comments! I am so happy this thread is so popular! I wrote a story about the charities, also known as the Graces, the goddesses of festivity, joy, and bueaty. They are some of my favorite mythological characters. Warning: This story contains female nudity/urination/desperation as well as (very little) masturbation, so if you are uncomfortable with any of those things, please do not read this story!

I also wrote several more stories about other minor goddesses like Iris, Hecate, Elithyia, Psyche, etc. Let me know if you want me to post those stories as well. (I probably will, lol!)

After downing gallons upon gallons of nectar, placing entire barrels of the delicious yellow drink into their systems, the three charities charged through the brush, desperate to find a place to relieve themselves.

There was Thalia the oldest, the goddess of festivities and banquets. There was of course Euphrosyne the goddess of laughter, cheer, and joy. And the youngest was Aglaea the goddess of beauty, glory, splendor, and adornment who was also the second wife of the forge god Hephestus.

The trio of sisters raced through the woods, grasping at their bare vulvas, and laughing as they went. The three sisters were completely and utterly nude. The charities - unlike the other gods - disliked clothing and found it restricting. They much rather would have their boobs bouncing freely below them and their vulvas licking the wind. Even as they lugged around bladders that weighed ten pounds a piece, the goddesses of cheer couldn't help but giggle and laugh. Although, that was probably on account of what they were about to do.

Falling against a tree, having been knocked over by her bladder, Aglaea squirmed and wiggled, her bare back digging into the rough bark. It was a cool day. The leaves rustled in the soft wind and Apollo’s sun chariot was as bright as ever. Birds chirped and reed pipes played over the hills. The charities could not have asked for a better day.

Bending her knees in and out repeatedly, Aglaea’s desperate gaze landed upon a clearing. The clearing contained a large pond and was secluded by a circle of reeds, tall thickets, and trees on all sides.

“Oh, ladies,” Aglaea giggled, calling to her sisters. “I think we found our spot.”

The three immortal ladies stood ankle deep in the water. The waves of the lake sent stabbing pain and a prickling sensation to the charities’ vulvas and bladders. The naked women jiggled in the lake, water splashing at their feet, their small breasts bouncing around, hands squeezing their small pussies for dear life.

The three graces stood side by side in the water. They stood oldest to youngest going from left to right.

“After that banquet of beverages, I’m bursting for a piss! Know what I’m saying,” Thalia giggled to her sisters.

“I know what you mean,” Euphrosyne exclaimed, moving her knees up and down so quickly, water splashed as high as her skinny thighs.

“I gotta tinkle so bad,” Aglaea whined, holding her lady bits with her hand bent at a funny angle while keeping her knee pressed straight into her vagina.

“Ready?” Thalia asked.

“Ready,” Euphrosyne agreed.

“Ready,” stated Aglaea.

Together, the three sisters instantly stopped squirming and dropped one hand to their sides and used the other to support their vulva into a pointed position. At the exact same time, three nearly identical trails of urine sped from the charities’ vulvas. Still standing, the charities’ urethras all widened allowing rivers of nectar to flow from their immortal bodies, shot in a slope through the skies, and crash down into the water below them. The trio sighed with bliss.

“I’m gonna pee the longest,” Aglaea giggled.

“We’ll see about that,” Thalia warned.

“I really had to go,” Euphorosyne laughed.

The three goddesses stood side by side as they allowed their bladders to drain straight into the lake water. The water rippled as three urine streams splashed against its surface.

With her free hand, Thalia rubbed her bulge like a mother expecting a child. Euphorosyne held her head back and whistled with joy. Aglaea moved her pussy lips around, making shapes with her urine in the water. Interestingly, despite drinking the approximate same amount, their streams were different shades. Euphroosyne’s stream was a deep yellow while Thalia’s was pale and Aglaea’s was as clear as water.

The three goddesses of cheer giggled as they gushed away their bladders’ burdens into the lake. The water rippled and a very loud gurgling sound was heard below them.

The charities stood in the lake peeing and peeing and peeing some more. At one point, Euphosyne’s stream stopped but she instantly restarted, giggling, “Oh, second wind incoming!”

A few more minutes of insane giggles, and a loud rumble was heard behind Aglaea. “Oh, my,” the goddess of splendor held a hand to her mouth, trying to appear embarrassed - even though she was not in the slightest.

“What’s wrong, Aglaea, ate too many beans!” Thalia laughed so hard, her stream rocketed to the opposite end of the pond.

“Hey, save distance for the next challenge,” Euphrosyne scolded between laughs.

The three graces happily peed into the water together. Between three very full godly bladders, the graces peed so much that the lake water itself became a vast shade of yellow. This only made the graces laugh even harder.

“You… You think we… We’re now standing in our own… Our own pee?” Aglaea laughed.

“Yep,” Thalia wailed. “Oh, man,” she wiped a tear from her eye. “Good times…”

Euphorsyne’s concentration was fixed on keeping her stream strong. The charities have been peeing for a very long time and their bladder bumps were pretty much gone at this point. Euphorsyne was the first to feel her bladder deflate back into a small pear shaped organ. The goddess of joy silently begged her bladder to keep peeing. Just a little longer. Her bladder just had to hold up. Euphorsyne refused to lose to her sisters! Euphorsyne knew she didn’t drink enough…

A couple minutes passed. Euphorsyne’s stream went on and off as the goddess of cheer struggled to drain as much as possible.

“Slowing down there,” Thalia laughed beside her.

“She’s almost out of ammo!” Aglaea wailed with excitement.

“No,” Euphorsyne denied what was obviously false. “I got loads more in the tank!”

“Uh-huh…” Aglaea muttered.

“We can literally see your stream ending,” Thalia cried. “We are standing right here, you know.”

“No, it isn’t,” fibbed Euphorsyne. Even as she said this, her stream ended. The goddess of joy quickly pushed down as hard as she could. A quick two second stream was ejected from her now fully voided bladder. Euphrosyne’s labia dripped away the final drops. And Euphrosyne lost the first game! “Blast,” cursed the goddess of joy before shaking her pussy dry and then stepping out of the lake.

This left Thalia and Aglaea, both of whom still had very strong streams.

Several more minutes passed by. While the two remaining contestants peed away their giant piss tanks, Euphrosyne lounged on a rock and played with her soft breasts, cupping each one in her hands and giving it a gentle squeeze.

Eventually, Aglaea gritted her teeth, grunting and groaning.

“Running low?” Thalia teased.

Aglaea felt her face go hot. She hates losing! Especially to her eldest sister. “No,” she lied.

“Then what’s with the look of concentration?” Before Aglaea even had a chance to answer, Thalia continued, “See, look at my face… I am perfectly relaxed because I know I have a lot left! Trust me, sweet heart, I do not need to worry about running out of this sweet, sweet nectar any time soon!”

Aglaea wished she had more hands so she could cover her ears. Thalia was just trying to get inside the goddess of glory’s head. But dread washed over Aglaea like her urine over lake water. The goddess of splendor was well aware that her bladder was almost dried up. She didn’t know how much longer she could pee. Yet, she continued pushing, praying Thalia would run low soon. But Thalia showed no signs. Thalia peed like a primordial god who held it in since the dawn of time. Aglaea begged her kidneys to add more fluids to her downstairs area. But by this time, it was more than likely all of the nectar she drank had already filtered through her bean shaped organs. Aglaea might lose…

And she did. Aglaea’s stream soon ended, her bladder was dry as a bone picked clean by vultures.

“Oh, well,” Aglaea put on her ‘gracious loser’ face. The goddess of glory placed a finger to her clit and began shaking. This did two things. One, it shook off the remaining drops of urine that still drip, drip, dripped from in between her thighs. And two, it turned Aglaea on.

Once her pussy was all dry (dry of urine that is) Aglaea returned to shore to get working on masturbating.

As Euphorsyne played with her tiny tits and Aglaea flicked her bean with all of her immortal strength, Thalia pissed like never before.

Thalia’s powerful jet of gold blasted down into the lake, lasting so long that Aglaea managed to cum… Twice. Thalia’s bladder had always been the largest! And this was the proof. Thalia’s steam soon ended and the final of the graces went to the lake bed to meet up with her sisters.

Euphrosyne lounged in the sun, twirling her long pecan hair. Aglaea sat criss-cross applesauce on a flat boulder, swaying back and forth with excitement.

“Looks like I won!” Thalia pumped her fists into the air.

“The first challenge, there are two more,” Euphrosyne added quickly.

“And I am looking forward to the next one,” Aglaea said.

The goddess of festivities rubbed her hands together. “I look forward to winning.”

Two weeks later, the graces crept behind some bushes. Apollo would be driving his sun chariot through the sky and would therefore be away from his archery range. It was daytime and the graces had the targets in sight. Time for the second challenge!

When they were sure Apollo wasn’t around, the charities emerged from their hiding spots. The three naked goddesses had three incredibly bloated bellies. Even as they ran, they heard distinctive sloshing sounds coming from their boiling hot bladders. But the three continued to hold back the flood. The graces had spent the past two weeks drinking as much water, wine, and nectar as their immortal bodies could stomach. They could barely hold back anymore. It was time to release the urine.

Once again, the three goddesses stood side by side going oldest to youngest, left to right. Standing before them were countless targets. Each grace stood before a target that had two other targets behind it, each one going at a farther ways away. The close target was ten meters away. The middle one was fifteen meters and the far one was twenty-five meters.

“Okay,” Thalia danced. “For this challenge, ladies, the goal is to hit the farthest target and get a bullseye. Whoever gets closest wins. It is also who hits the target first wins. And remember, it is not about distance, it is about aim. So, I hope your aim is true.”

“Thanks, Thalia,” Aglaea smiled.

“And of course, when I say ‘your aim is true’, I really mean mine,” Thalia snickered.

Euphrosyne happily hit her older sister across the arm.

“Okay,” Aglaea said quickly. “My bladder truly can’t hold any longer,” Aglaea felt her ocean of urine surge towards the exit and quickly wedged a hand between her slim thighs to stop it. “I just gotta let it out, girls.”

“Me too,” Euphrosyne agreed, moving her feet in careful patterns.

“Then, let the second challenge begin!” Thalia cried.

And with that, all three charities once again rested one hand at their side and used the second hand to pull their pussies higher. The trio took aim and fired.

Three long streams of piss rocketed from the goddesses’ genitals. Once again, their pee holes expanded and allowed long squirts of piss to exit. Given how much pressure the trio had on their bladders, it was no surprise that their streams were extra powerful. The three urine streams flew through the skies and sailed towards Apollo’s targets.

In the bright light of day, the graces once again noticed the differences in their streams. Euphrosyne’s stream was the clearest this time. Thalia’s was a tad darker and Aglaea’s urine was a bright yellow.

Euphrosyne’s pee river hit the bullseye of the closest target. Thalia’s steam hit the farthest northwest outer part of the middle target. Aglaea’s stream rained down on the magpie of the close target. The godly girls giggled and grit their gums in concentration.

The graces continued to adjust their streams accordingly. Thalia moved lower, allowing her urine to fall upon the inner circle of the middle target. Aglaea, meanwhile, decided not to waste time on the close target and instead arched her back and pulled her pussy, allowing her stream to shoot past the middle target. Aglaea’s fountain landed somewhere beyond the far target. The goddess of glory struggled to pull her steam back. That left Euphrosyne who was busy sending her urine stream to the middle target. Euphrosyne was determined to hit every bullseye, not just the far one. Euphrosyne’s stream landed in the grass beside her middle target. The goddess of laughter’s stream just fizzed on the ground until she manovered her labia to send her stream gushing straight onto the west outer ring of the middle target.

The goddesses spent several minutes as their bladders drained, dousing Apollo’s targets in piss.

Euphrosyne’s stream landed on the bullseye of the middle target and the laughter goddess moved onto the final target. Aglaea’s urine stream hissed straight onto the rubber of the western magpie ring of the far target. Thalia had managed to get her stream onto the far target. But Thalia ended up shooting her piss too far and was now unintentionally peeing onto a tree trunk over forty meters away. Too bad. If this was distance, Thalia might have this in the bag. But as it is, this is aiming.

The three continued peeing, allowing their bladders to reduce in size bit by bit. Thalia’s stream landed on the leg of the final target. Euphrosyne hosed down the southern outer circle of the final target. Aglaea tried to move her stream to the bullseye of the final target. The goddess of glory could smell victory! But unfortunately for her, she ended up moving her steam too far and it flew into the air, making an arch, and crashing to the ground beyond the final target.

The entire time, the three sisters stayed focused on their work. All three of them were extra tempted to look at one another to see how they were doing. But they refused to take their eyes off of their own stream for even a second.

Suddenly, Euphrosyne shouted, “Victory!”

Both Thalia and Aglaea’s heads snapped in the middle sister’s direction. Euphrosyne’s golden waterway was directly splattering against the bullseye of the twenty-five meter far target.

“No,” Thalia whined.

“You cheat,” cried Aglaea.

“Nope. Just got skill,” Euphrosyne smiled proudly as she held perfectly still and allowed the rest of her bladder to drain straight onto the final target of the range.

“Well, we may have lost,” Aglaea said. “But I am personally interested in seeing if I can beat the target.”

“Me too,” Thalia said. And so the sisters kept peeing.

Thalia soon ran empty and cursed, silently stepping away. Euphrosyne was the next to run out. The goddess of cheer emptied herself onto the final bullseye and left the range with a wide goofy grin.

Aglaea managed to place her stream onto the inner ring of the final target. But as she did so, her stream began to die down. The low pressure of the urine caused her stream to retract and soon Aglaea found herself peeing the final few drops of her bladder at her bare feet. Aglaea scratched her right boob and turned to follow her sisters, her pussy still dripping with piss.

The graces laughed and laughed.

“So, I won the first challenge and Euphrosyne won the second,” the goddess of festivities stated. “That just leaves one left. And it is arguably the most exciting of them all!”

On that note, the three charities skipped away, laughing, wondering if Apollo would return and be angry that his targets were covered in pee. Probably. They also wondered if Apollo could see them from his sun chariot. Also probably.

Two more weeks passed. Once again, the graces had spent those weeks drinking as many fluides as they could ingest. And now they all wanted out.

The graces came to another pond (not the same one they used as a toilet in the first challenge). The graces once again stood ankle deep in water. Just standing in the water was enough to send stabbing pains to their bladders that continued to request a nice voiding session. But the graces all denied their urge to micturate. Instead, the trio of sister goddesses stood in the water, their stomachs bulging so far past their faces, they could have been used as nightstands to hold glasses of water and lamps. The very thought made the trio tremble. The garces’ navels all stood out against the flesh of their fat tummies. Their bladders were as round as the wheels of a chariot and as hard as the skull of a giant. The trio quaked and wobbled around the water.

The three goddesses went extra heavy with the liquid intake over the past two weeks. While they held it for the same amount of time as the rest of their challenges, they drank nearly double the amount. Their bladders ballooned outwards. They felt as if all the pressure of all the world’s oceans was resting on their sphincter muscles. Perfect for the final game!

“Okay,” Thalia addressed her sisters, stumbling around the water. “For the final challenge, we hold and see who can last longest.”

“You forgot the best part,” Aglaea giggled.

“Right, we bounce against one another, trying to make each other lose,” Thalia grimaced from the weight she carried around inside.

“My bladder is so full,” Euphrosyne moaned, running her hands over her rock-hard bladder bulge. “Let’s do this!”

“And remember,” Thalia added. “No using your hands or your feet to knock each other down. Just your bladders,”

The three sisters began to circle each other like a gang of robbers attacking an innocent citizen. Then out of nowhere, they charged. Their six feet cut through the water, sending out small waves below their feet. Gallons of drink bounced inside their guts. The three graces met and rammed theri bladder bulges into one another. The three sisters feel back, grasping themselves in pain. They charged again, pushing their bladders into each other like a bladder version of a chicken fight.

The three colossal bladders banged back and forth against one another like billiard balls. The three goddesses moaned and placed firm hands in their goddesshoods before attacking again.

Aglaea bounced her bladder off of Thalia. Thalia fell back into Euphrosyne who smashed her bladder against Thalia’s. Thalia stumbled, the impact of her sister’s boulder-like bladder caused the goddess of festivities to leak a bit. Thalia - more determined than ever now - ran at Euphrosyne. Euphrosyne side stepped Thalia’s attack, allowing Thalia to run straight past her. Euphrosyne - satisfied with her moves - didn’t notice Aglaea advancing on her until it was too late. Aglaea’s bladder battered against Euphrosyne's. Euphrosyne managed to regain her footing and pushed back against Aglaea’s bladder with equal force. Euphrosyne and Aglaea both clenched their muscles with nothing but sheer will as their bladder bumps interlocked in competition. Aglaea and Euphrsoyne’s boobs also pressed against each other so each goddess could feel her sister’s nipples digging into her skin.

Thalia charged through the water, her feet moving in great strides as she brought her own bulge down upon her sisters. Thalia’s bulge was so great and she delivered such force that both of her sisters were knocked from their feet and flew backwards. Euphrosyne fell on her butt causing a wave of water to wash over her hair, face, legs, and bladder. Euphrosyne felt herself leak into the water from the impact. Aglaea meanwhile managed to steady herself, but she continued to wobble, not having the best footing.

Thalia flew towards Aglaea. Agleae finally managed to regain her footing and charged at Thalia. The two goddesses met, their bulges banged into one another, condensing each one. Thalia felt a dribble roll down her bare legs. The two goddesses backed up and then went at each other like a bullfighter and a bull. Their bladders collided and threw both graces back. Yet they charged at each other once more.

Still in the water, Euphrosyne lay on her side, allowing Thalia to trip over the goddess of laughter’s giant bulge. Thalia fell over Euphrosyne’s piss belly and crashed into the water, landing straight on her own bladder. Thalia’s bladder ended up getting sandwiched between the lake floor and Thalia’s weight. This pressure was enough to cause the goddess of festivities to leak a five second long urine stream.

Euphrosyne was back on her feet. Aglaea advanced on her. Euphrosyne played defensive, continuously moving out of Aglaea’s way. Feeling ready to leak herself, Aglaea took a pause to hold her hairless pussy. Euphrosyne took this as her opening and flew across the lake towards her younger sister.

Euphrosyne’s bladder rammed against Aglaea’s so hard, Aglaea flew backwards through the air. Aglaea being a graceful grace, managed to do a flip in the air and land on her feet. But twirling around as she did caused Aglaea’s pee contents to flip upside down and back again. Agleae squeezed herself, silently praying to her bladder to stay with her.

Thalia rose shakily to her feet. Thalia’s bladder was extra heavy now. The urine was so condensed inside, it hurt incredibly bad. But Thalia couldn’t lose. If she won this final game, she won the entire competition. She had to keep going!

Thalia stood trembling as Euphrosyne sprinted over the water towards her older sister. Thalia stepped to the side, trembling as she did so. Euphrosyne - anticipating this - also stepped to the side, allowing her bladder to sweep Thalia off her feet and cause the goddess of festivity to fall to the ground, water splashing around her for a second time. Euphrosyne went in for her final move.

Thalia lay on her back, her mountain of a bladder standing high up into the air. Euphrosyne lifted a foot and stepped onto her sister’s bulge.

“N… No feet, no feet!” Thalia cried, her voice trembling.

Euphrosyne smiled mischievously. “You only said we couldn’t use our feet to knock each other down. Well sis… You are already down for the count.”

Fear spread across Thalia’s mind. She was well aware that Euphrosyne was correct. The rules only said the charities could not use their hands or feet to knock each other down. But Thalia was already down.

Euphrosyne lowered her foot down. The pressure inside Thalia’s bladder shot as high as the god of air, Aither’s domain. Thalia’s face twisted in pain and agony as the pressure grew higher than the banquet goddess ever thought possible. Still, Thalia held on. Euphrosyne finished her sister off by lifting her second foot and placing that as far down into Thalia’s rock as possible.

The goddess of festivity felt her entire sister’s weight crushing her bladder. It was enough to cause Thalia to lose all control. A smile came across Thalia’s face as a yellow cloud appeared in the water below her. And if the graces looked carefully, they could see a swarm of bubbles leaving Thalia’s labia along with a massive stream that shot into the water before fading away. The yellow cloud moved outwards and Thalia moaned with bliss, a stupid smile on her face, her eyebrows relaxed as she emptied herself completely.

Thalia still gushing away, Aglaea snuck up behind Euphrosyne and slammed her in her slim and round buttocks with her own bulge. Euphrosyne flew off of Thalia’s bulge and landed a couple of meters away.

Aglaea wished she could roundhouse kick Euphrosye’s bladder to get her to go down. But using feet was against the rules. At least when it came to knocking each either down that is.

“Just you and me, Aglaea,” Euphrosyne challenged.

The two goddesses went back to circling each other while their sister peed and masturbated into the water. Aglaea had to take another quick break to hold herself and bend her one knee into her opposite knee pit.

“Looking desperate, Aglaea,” Euphrosyne taunted, intimidating her sister. . The laughter goddess kept her hands out in front of her, ready to block any attack. “I’ll bet you just crave to empty like Thalia’s doing!”

“It does feel good,” Thalia moaned, stroking her clit so hard, her stream flew across the underwater portion of the lake, making the yellow cloud grow and shrink.

Agleae bent down, grasping her aching vulva. “I can hold,” she said, hoping that was the truth. “Let’s go…”

And so, the two remaining charities charged. Their bulges bounced and bobbed off of each other. The two flew around the lake bed, their bladders striking against each other. The two remained locked, pushing their bladders back and forth like a tug-of-war. The two siblings bumped bladders with all their might.

“You gonna bust?” Euphrosyne teased, her face right up against Aglaea’s. Again, their small breasts pushed down against one another. “Huh, you gonna break?”

“Never!” Aglaea pushed with all of her strength and Euphrosyne stumbled backwards, water splishing and splashing around her ankles. Aglaea ran at her sister. The goddess of glory’s bladder met Euphrosyne’s bulge head-on. Euphrosyne closed her eyes and grit her teeth, wincing from the collision.

Before her sister had time to recover, Aglaea rammed herself into Euphrosyne again and again, pushing Euphrosyne farther back. Several small leaks and spurts escaped Euphrosyne’s clenched lips. Euphrosyne continuously worked to get her sphincter to seal itself again, but she was losing the battle with Aglaea and the battle with her bladder.

Feeling the temperate lake water below her, Aglaea got an idea. She pushed into Euphrosyne so hard that the goddess of cheer fell backwards. Aglaea lifted her throbbing pussy and careful only to let out a squirt, she allowed herself to leak. Aglaea’s stream rained through the air and landed against Euphrosyne’s fat bulge. Aglaea’s hot urine ran down Euphrosyne’s bump. The steaming warm urine pressed against her already blazing hot bulge made holding back the flood a nightmare for Euphrosyne.

Euphrosyne felt herself leaking some more cargo. She now had no choice but to double over and grab her labia in her tight fists. With Euphrosyne down, the goddess of glory went in for the kill. Aglaea bolted towards her older sister and punched her bladder bulge into her sister’s.

Euphrosyne felt her bladder beating against her sphincter. Her bladder pounded to be released. And as Euphrosyne felt Aglaea’s bladder thwack against hers, she slid back, not falling down, still standing, but sliding through the mud and water, Euphrosyne felt her bladder’s time was up. Euphrsoyne still stood doubled over, holding herself, as her dam burst. All the water, wine, and nectar the goddess drank voided into the lake below her. Countless streams gushed from the goddess of cheer’s lips down her legs and into the water below.

Euphrosyne allowed herself to fall down, giving into the weight of her bladder. Water splashed around the middle sibling as she sat in the water and a deep yellow cloud came from her vulva as well.

The goddess of joy felt waves of… Well joy washed over her. Euphrosyne’s relieving piss was the most euphoric feeling the goddess of joy and laughter had ever felt.

“I won!” Aglaea leapt into the air, but her pressurized bladder quickly made her regret that decision. “Right, sorry, bladder,” Agleae apologized to her bulge. The goddess of beauty then held her breathtaking vulva as high as it would go and peed standing into the lake below. The goddess sighed as ecstasy filled her mind. Ecstasy at her release but also ecstasy of the knowledge that she won this final challenge. The most powerful stream hissed from in between the thighs of the splendor goddess. Aglaea wished her husband, Hephestus could see this. Aglaea’s stream was even more powerful than Zeus’ lightning bolts. The relief felt good!

The trio of sister goddesses sighed of joy and laughed their heads off as they all drained their massively overfilled bladders into the pond. The goddesses peed for so long that it was night time by the time the last of them had finished.

The three naked goddesses regrouped back on shore, leaving the pond now tinted with a heavy golden shade of liquid.

“So much better,” Thalia moaned.

“What a relief,” Euphrosyne scratched her shiny butt cheeks.

Aglaea just passed gas again and giggled.

“So, I peed the longest,” Thalia said.

“I had the best aim,” Euphrosyne said.

“And I beat you both in a bladder fight,” Aglaea said.

“So…” The three goddesses looked at one another before saying in sync, “I guess we all win!” They laughed and hugged each other, pressing their wet naked bodies against one another.

Suddenly, someone emerged from the bushes. It was Aphrodite the goddess of love and beauty. “There my handmaidens are,” Aphrodite cried. “I’ve been searching all over for you three. I have a date with this handsome mortal shepherd named Anchises in a few hours and I need to look hot! Well, I am already hot, but… I need you three to do your thing.”

As Aphrodite’s handmaidens, it was quite literally Thalia, Euphrosyne, and Aglaea’s jobs to fix Aphrodite up for any and all dates she had. (And she had a lot of them!)

“Shepherd?” Thalia asked. “Really?”

“We mean no offense,” Euphrosyne went on.

“But that doesn’t really seem like your type of dude,” Aglaea finished.

“Yeah, well, Zeus is all pissed off that I always mess with his love life, so he had Hermes steal my girdle… You know, the one that makes people fall in love with each other. Well, Zeus made me fall for Anchises.”

The graces looked on to one another then back at their boss.

“You know this information and you’re still in love with Anchises?” Thalia asked, confused.

Aphrodite shrugged her sexy shoulders. “Even I cannot resist the powers of my girdle. Besides, trust me ladies, Anchises may be a shepherd, but he is one hot hunk of man,” the goddess of love smacked her lips. “Now come, girls. I need my hair done, my make-up done, I need some clothes… Why is that lake yellow?”

Aphrodite stared through the darkness of Erebos at the yellow pond.

“Um… Lacus the goddess of lakes is trying something new,” Euphrosyne lied.

Good enough for Aphrodite, Aphrodite led the charities back to Mount Olympus. As Aphrodite went on and on about all the work she needed done and how little time she had to do it, the three charities turned to one another and covered their mouths to keep from laughing.

This next story is about the minor goddess Hebe goddess of youth and servants. She was also the cupbearer to the gods. Let the record state that in actual mythology, Hebe had tripped and spilled nectar everywhere. Angry at her. Zeus fired Hebe and replaced her with the handsome mortal prince Ganymede. That being said, Hebe is one of my favorite goddesses and I like to believe she eventually became cupbearer to Olympus again. Given Hera's temper toward her husband's lovers, Hera probably discovered Zeus was having an affair with Ganymede and she likely killed him. Therefore, Hebe would have then been asked to return to her post as cupbearer.

Anyway here's the story. Enjoy! 🙂

“HEBE!!! WHERE IS THAT NECTAR?!?” Zeus’ voice bellowed from the other room.

“C… Coming Lord… Father… Zeus…” Hebe tried her hardest to keep her voice from trembling. But it was difficult when she was in such dire need of… Answering the call of Gaia, mother earth.

The goddess of youth mumbled and grumbled under her breath. She leaned against a table and her legs kept kicking out behind her. Hebe tilted an overflowing jar, sending golden nectar pouring from the spout into a goblet. The task was torture! Not only did Hebe have to watch and listen to the flowing of liquids, but it just had to be a liquid that resembled urine! Why couldn’t the gods drink water for once? At this point, Hebe may prefer to handle that substance instead. At least it isn’t that dreaded color yellow…

“HEBE! WHERE IS THAT NECTAR!” Zeus shouted again.

“About to be in my toga,” Hebe huffed, wrapping her fingers around her crotch.

“I AM GROWING IMPATIENT!” Zeus thundered.

“You don’t say,” Hebe quietly cursed the lightning god. Hebe stacked her trays high with heavy goblets of golden juices. She then placed each tray on her shoulders, and wobbling like she was on the Argo, Hebe stumbled into the dining area.

Gathered around a massive table sat the Olympian gods. Still struggling to stand still, Hebe maneuvered herself down the table, setting down a goblet in front of each god. Just holding the sloshing cup of yellow made Hebe need to clench her muscles with extra force. The youth goddess could feel the coldness of the nectar on her sweaty palms as she handed each god in turn their goblets.

“Finally,” Zeus grunted. Sitting on Zeus’ left was his wife, Hera. On his right was Zeus’ own son, Hercules (also known as Hebe’s husband) the god of labor.

“What took you so long,” Zeus demanded, his eyes glowing with untapped rage. “You know, dear daughter, when I fired Ganymede as cupbearer to the gods, and replaced him with you,” the way he said you sent shivers down Hebe’s spine. “I expected you to be twice as diligent as he was,” Zeus grunted.

“I thought you fired that mortal for me,” Hebe scowled.

“Yes, yes,” Zeus waved her aside.

“Give her a break, father,” Hercules said in his wife’s defense. “It is not my wife’s fault she is slow. Perhaps Ganymede should give her pointers.”

Hebe muttered so quietly no one heard, “Thanks a lot, babe.” Hebe knew she could always count on her husband to rescue her. She didn’t know what she was expecting. Hercules had a way of pretending to aid her, only to take his snooty father’s side in the end. Hebe often felt he did it to hurt her more than help him.

Hera fired an angry look to the god of labor. “I think not,” the family goddess spat. “I do not wish any of my husband’s… Lovers… To ever visit Olympus again! It is bad enough you are here, my husband’s son with another woman!”

“Agreed… It is bad enough I have to see you every day,” Hercules retorted.

Hera came back with a comeback and then Hercules. The argument flew back and forth between the two like arrows firing at enemy lines. The other gods just watched, some chanted. Yep, a normal Olympian family dinner all right.

Dionysus raised his wine glass - unlike the others, he wished for wine, naturally. Dionysus cheered on one of Hercules' insults. The wine god then held back his head.

Hebe - having finished pacing out drinks - was free to squeeze herself behind one of the serving trays she used as a shield. Hebe’s bright blue eyes filled with agony as she was forced to endure watching Dionysus’ red wine spill on the table. The liquid splashed around like water from a crinkled-up watering can.

Hebe wanted so badly to excuse herself. But she knew she was unallowed. As the god’s cupbearer, the youth goddess was forced to stay for the entire meal. Mostly because she was required to pass out the food as well as drink.

Hebe held her eyes shut, interlocking her slim fingers around the crotch of her toga. She held the tray upwards so no one could see her desperate attempt at staying dry.

Hebe could feel her bodily nectar shift around inside. This is what she got for putting off going to the bathroom for nine days. The Olympian family was demanding. Hebe rarely had time to herself. Even more rare was getting a chance to alleviate her needs. Hebe did not dare ask. Especially during supper. Truth be told, Hebe would have found it difficult to ask anyway. She was far too embarrassed to have anyone know what was going on down in her pelvis.

“I shall be back with the meal,” Hebe said, cutting off one of Hera’s comebacks. And then, swiftly, Hebe made her way back to the kitchen, clutching both serving trays as tight as she could.

If the family suspected something, they said nothing. Probably for the best knowing this family!

Hebe spent the next several minutes preparing the main course. All the cooking was done by the nature spirits. All Hebe had to do was put the food on trays and carry them out to the gods. But given the vast amount of gods, she was expected to serve, the youth goddess had to fill up several trays and take several trips.

As Hebe placed the food onto the trays, she secretly pee-pee danced to her heart’s content, taking pride in no one seeing her. Hebe constantly grasped at her crotch, kicked her legs behind her, clawed at her toga, anything and everything to keep the floodgates closed.

As she squirmed, Hebe was vaguely aware of two new arrivals entering her kitchen. Hebe knew who they were immediately, and any doubts on the matter were instantly cleared when she heard the phrase, “Hi, mom,” coming from Alexiares. Standing directly behind the goddess of youth were her twin sons, Alexiares and Anicetus.

Now Hebe had to be extra careful not to squirm. She didn’t want her adult sons to know what was going on with her, that she was one wrong move away from having a godly-sized bathroom accident. Granted, the twins were adults now, but still, they would always be Hebe’s boys.

“H… Ho… Hi, boys,” Hebe was well aware of the shakiness of her breath. She prayed to all the gods her sons did not notice. Hebe kept her legs crossed in front of her. She swallowed, sweat leaking down her cheeks.

“We just finished our shift guarding Olympus. And we wanted to see if you needed a hand,” Anicetus said.

Hebe felt herself get extra warm inside. And not just from her overfilled urinary bladder. Hebe had the best sons! They were constantly looking out for her and always wanted to be of assistance. There were times Hebe thought Alexiares and Anicetus were the only gods in all of Olympus that cared for her. But at the end of the day, Hebe just needed her boys.

“I… I’m okay, boys,” Hebe insisted.

“You sure, mom,” Anicetus challenged. “You look awfully sweaty and shaky.”

“Are the gods overworking you again?” Alexiares made a face that told Hebe he was ready to pound some immortals.

“N… No… I’m fine,” Hebe insisted. The youth goddess lifted a tray packed with food. That’s when she was hit with a sudden jolt of her blasted pee pouch.

“Oh!” Hebe wailed. The youth goddess stumbled. The tray almost crashed to the floor. Fortunately for Hebe, her sons were as light on their feet as the charities.

Anicetus lunged forward and caught the tray before it crashed to the ground. Alexiares, meanwhile, grabbed his mother and helped her stand up straight.

No matter how hard she tried, Hebe’s willpower gave out and she grasped her throbbing vagina through her toga. Hebe whimpered, her eyes glittered with tears.

Anicetus set down the golden plate of food. “Mom, are you sure you are okay?”

“You look like you have to…” Alexiares’ voice trailed.

“HEBE!” Zeus’ powerful roar shook the building. Hebe could feel her ocean of urine serging towards the exit. Zeus’ shout scared Hebe into nearly losing cargo.

Hebe could no longer resist… She held herself with both hands. Against all odds, Hebe managed to keep herself closed. Not a single drop leaked… But it was about to. Hebe’s lip was curled into her mouth. She bobbed up and down like a ship. Her face was a mix of sweat, tears, and redness. Her eyes bulged. As did her bladder. Hebe’s bladder extended past her waistline and bulged over her toga.

Alexiares rested a hand on Hebe’s shoulder. “Mom…” His voice was as soothing as Pan’s bedtime music. “Do you need to… You know…”

Hebe felt ridiculous having her sons tell her when it was time to go. But she couldn’t lie to them. Especially now that they knew the truth anyway. Unlike their father and grandfather, Alexiares and Anicetus weren’t dumb. Hercules wasn’t that dumb, he was just a pain at times…

Hebe reluctantly nodded. “I haven’t gotten a break in days… And I have just been putting it off because it will take forever to empty, but…”

The twins exchanged looks. They had the task of assisting their mother down to a science. The twins knew exactly what the other was thinking and they leaped into action. Anicetus snatched the tray of food and rushed it out to the gods. Alexiares, meanwhile, placed a gentle arm around his mother and whispered to her gently, “Come on, mom, I got you,” and began guiding his mother away.

Hebe wanted to thank her sons, but she had to piss so badly, she feared if she opened her mouth, urine would tumble out.

Unfortunately, the closest bathroom was on the other side of the dining hall, meaning Hebe and Alexiares would have to go past the other gods.

“Anicetus,” Zeus was saying as Hebe and Alexiares emerged from the kitchen area. “What in my name are you doing serving the food!” Zeus’ stormy eyes landed on Hebe. “Hebe, get over here and…”

“Mom’s on a break,” Anicetus said flatly, setting a plate of rolls down in the center of the table.

“Break!” Zeus scoffed. “Says who?”

“Says us,” Anicetus set a plate of steak down before Athena. Alexiares and Anicetus may fear Zeus - like mostly everyone - but there were three things the twin sons of Hercules and Hebe cared about: Guarding Olympus, guarding the mortal world, and guarding their mother’s well-being. When any one of those three things were threatened, Alexiares and Anicetrus were fearless.

“Excuse you,” Zeus grumbled. “You do not have authority to…”

“You do not have the authority to force our poor mother to work for nine days and nine nights,” Anicetus’ rage turned towards Zeus.

“Watch your tongue,” Zeus warned.

Hebe wanted to silence her son. She didn’t want him to be at the wrong end of Zeus’ lightning bolt. But at the present moment, Hebe’s brain was so waterlogged with urine, she could barely think.

Anicetus then did something that no one has ever done to the king of Olympus. He made a fist. That was it. He made a fist. He didn’t punch Zeus or even advance toward him. He just held up his fingers enclosed into a ball. Zeus stared at Anicetus and Anicetus stared back at him.

Zeus finally backed down and grunted towards Hebe, “Five minutes.”

“She’ll return when she pleases,” Anicetus’ face filled with fury. Zeus didn’t respond. Even Zeus was smart enough not to mess with the twin sons of Hercules when their mother was concerned.

Some of the gods glimpsed at Hebe as she stumbled across the floor, Alexiares helping her stand. Hebe had no choice anymore but to squeeze her privates and waddle like an elderly. Alexiares glared at the onlookers. That was enough to cause the gods’ gazes to break and they quickly returned to their meals. Hebe was so foolish not to go to her sons from the beginning. If she had, she would have gotten a break nine days ago!

While Anicetus continued to pass out the main course, Alexiares managed to get his mother past the monster-sized dining table and they started down the hall.

Hebe kept fumbling and slipping over her bare feet. She knew if Alexiares wasn’t here, she would surely fall. Hebe kept a hand bunching up her toga and allowed all of her weight to go against her adult son. They were halfway down the hall when another urge, this the worst one yet, collided with Hebe and caused her to fall over. Alexiares held her in place, holding onto his mother tighter than ever before. Hebe could feel the wave of urine washing over her, banging against her sphincter so hard, it was like holding back an army of Minotaurs.

“I… Can’t hold it…” Hebe whimpered, tears streaming her face like rainwater through a leaky roof.

“We’re almost there,” Alexiares said. Hebe noticed how calm her son sounded. That made her feel calmer as well. On the bright side, Hebe knew, even if she did have an accident, the other gods wouldn’t dare make fun of her or risk suffering the wrath of her angry, strong sons.

Hebe could no longer separate her calves, even for a second. Hebe’s only option left was to limp forwards at a tortoise’s pace. Hebe could quite literally feel her youth draining away as she placed all of her energy into holding back the torrent of nectar that wanted so badly to exit her system.

At long last, Hebe and Alexiares made it to the open restroom.

“Are you okay from here, mom,” Alexaries asked.

Hebe gave a weak nod. She then hobbled into the bathroom. Alexiares gently closed the door behind her and then processed to stand guard.

Hebe had the toilet in sight. In a rush of excitement, a small dribble of three or four drops spilled into her toga, instantly getting absorbed by the fabric. Hebe took two great steps, feeling her sphincter give in, Hebe pulled up her toga and her sphincter relaxed and her pee hole expanded open. She didn’t even have time to properly sit down before a geyser of hot yellow piss fired from her divine cooch and psssshhhed into the bowl. Hebe stood above the toilet for a second, peeing like a man as she panted and huffed. The goddess of youth slowly lowered herself down onto the toilet. Sitting the wrong way on the bowl, Hebe held her toga in a heap against her breasts and gushed her bladder away into the bowl.

Hebe laid her head against the wall and moaned again and again. The youth goddess could feel her golden juices blasting away, liters at a time. Sweat dripped down Hebe’s chin and her eyes watered with relief and with dust from the back of the toilet. Hebe’s bladder drained and the youth goddess felt ready to scream with joy.

\Hebe’s mind, filled with endorphins, was quite disappointed with the initial sensation of blessed, long awaiting relief that died down and was replaced with a mediocre pee. Hebe sat on the back of the toilet peeing for the gods know how long! Hebe drummed her fingers on the back of the bowl in boredom. She spread her legs even farther and took comfort in watching a thick stream of piss jet itself from in between her wrinkled labia and splash down into the toilet, the water having gone bright yellow from her stream.

The toilet automatically flushed several times, but Hebe just kept filling it back up easily. The youth goddess’ face returned to its former beautiful self and her bladder bulge had ceased to exist… For now anyway.

Hebe looked up, feeling her stream slowly dribble away. She pushed, forcing out one last strong squirt, and then the stream stopped. Hebe waited for a second, listening to a soft drip drip as the last drops rolled down her pussy into the water. Hebe wiped herself with a clay shard and then stood, adjusting her toga.

Hebe flushed and exited the bathroom.

“Feeling better?” Alexiares kept his arms crossed, standing in the exact pose he used to guard Mouth Olympus. Hebe loved her sons’ ‘Don’t mess with me’ looks.

Hebe wrapped her arms around her son, and he held her back. Hebe was a head shorter than her twin sons. It was strange having children that were taller and stronger than you. “Thank you, baby, I am much better,” Hebe sobbed.

Anicetus appeared.

“Let me guess,” Hebe wiped away her tears. “Zeus is angry with me?”

“Not if he knows what is good for him,” Anicetus replied. “I just passed out dessert. That should keep the gods busy for a while.”

“Desert?” Hebe’s face went red again. “How long was I in there?”

The twins turned to one another, silently debating on how to answer their mother’s question.

“A half-hour,” Alexiares stated.

“A half hour!” Hebe wailed. That was a long urination, even by godly standards.

“Mother, if Zeus refuses to give you a break again,” Anicetus began.

“I tell my sons,” Hebe smiled.

“You tell your sons,” the twins agreed together.

“And we will take care of it,” Alexaires finished.

Now Hebe did cry. Between the relief her bladder felt and her sons always having her back, Hebe could not help but wail like the Algea - the personifications of sorrow. Hebe’s sons hugged her, comforting their bawling mother. Hebe held her sons, knowing this was the best feeling in the world.

I love this. PLEASE add some male omo stuff with the gods, possibly femdom?? 🙏

}}

Unfortunately, I haven't yet done many stories like this. I did however do one story where Hermes (the god of messages is urinating) and his wife, Peitho (goddess of seduction) grows male genitals to allow her to pee in the sink. I plan on posting this story at a later date. This is sadly the only male/femdom story I have done as of now. But I can do some more if you like!

Will you be making stories about other mythologies?

I certainly can if you are interested! I was planning on doing a story with Bastet and maybe Isis from Egyptian mythology. But I want to post all of my greek mythology stories first lol!
