Welcome back for another installment of Desperation Documentary. Last time, as you will recall, we followed around Lacy on her journey of having to hold in a full bladder. We learned much about desperation. Female desperation that is. As a viewer of the last documentary pointed out, what about male desperation? Well, today, we shall be diving into that topic. Enjoy!

Anthony, a twenty-eight-year-old man, has just arrived at his hotel. Our new friend has been on the road for nearly six hours now and has only taken a single bathroom break. Anthony is in town for his sister’s wedding. His sister offered him to stay at her house, but he didn’t wish to be a burden.

Anthony could feel the large coffee he drank simmering inside his pee pouch down below. Anthony decided to push his need onto the back burner, so to speak, and unpack. That way, he would not have to worry about it later.

Anthony spent the next forty-five minutes clearing out his bags and setting up his hotel room. He would stay here for a few days, so he wanted everything in a proper place until then.

Luggage taken care of, Anthony decided to reassess his bathroom needs and came to a conclusion that he should visit the facilities.

Anthony stood, feeling the pressure inside shift and press on his penis, and made his way to the open restroom in his hotel area. But just as Anothony was nearing the open door, he received a call from the hotel room’s phone. Choosing to wait a few extra moments, not wishing the call to be dropped, Anthony made his way to the phone.

“Hello?” Anthony spoke into the earpiece.

“Hello, sir,” said a feminine voice on the other end. “I hate to inform you of this, however, the hotel appears to be having some plumbing issues. In other words, if you use any running water right now, the pipes will burst and there will be a flood.”

Notice the look of dread wash over Anthony’s face. His eyes get big and his breathing slows. Fear rockets across Anthony’s brain and his skin goes pale and clammy. “Okay,” the man speaks softly. “Do you know when the plumbing will be fixed?”

“We are working on the issue as we speak, sir,” the woman reassures our soon to be desperate friend. “But it looks like the plumbing will be out until morning.”

Anthony’s look of horror worsens as he hears this sentence. “What do I do until then?” Asks Anthony, whose bladder appears to be a five out of ten now.

“There is a gas station a couple blocks down you may use,” the woman says. “We shall give a call when the plumbing is back.”

Anthony thanks the woman, understanding this is out of her hands, and hangs up. Anthony sits on his bed, grateful she called when she did. A few more seconds and Anthony would have unintentionally flooded the entire hotel.

Anthony now weighs his options. He could go and visit that gas station now, sure. But Anthony has just been on the road for six hours. Truth be told, the inside of a vehicle is the last thing he wanted to see right now. And so, Anthony decides to rest and use the gas station later. Anthony unloads his pockets from all the extra weight they carry around, and then lies his tired head down on the hotel pillows.

Anthony shifts a moan. He rolls over to notice the alarm clock of the hotel. Anthony nearly jumps from his socks upon seeing what the blood red digits said before him. 8:40 P.M. Anthony must have fallen asleep. He slept for four hours. Worst yet, as the fog of sleep slowly lifts from his brain, Anthony realizes how urgent his need now is. Observe how Anthony shoots upwards and grasps his aching penis. The pressure has since increased in his member. Anthony feels as if his penis swallowed an entire watermelon.

Anthony climbs to his feet and stumbles to his hotel door. Anthony does quick mental math and realizes it has been nearly eight hours since his last restroom visit. And with that coffee he drank on the way over here, his bladder is now extended past his trousers and looks an awfully lot like the shell of a turtle right now.

On his way to the main door, Anthony is forced to pass the bathroom. He wishes he could use it. Perhaps the plumbing is fixed. But Anthony has no way of knowing. The woman on the phone did say the plumbing would be out until morning. Notice how Anthony hesitates before the door to the lavatory. His mind is racing with ideas and thoughts and fears. Perhaps, thinks Anthony, I could use the restroom. I could just use the toilet and not flush. But then, Anthony would have to sleep in the same room with an unflushed toilet bowl. Watch as Anthony shakes his head, knowing this scheme is unacceptable. Anthony has always been grossed out by germs. He refuses to sleep in a room with a urine filled bowl sitting right through the wall.

Anthony decides to head to the gas station. Even as Anthony stumbles to the elevator, he can feel his bladder bouncing up and down, up and down - very similar to the movements made by a po-go stick - inside his abdomen. Each time his bladder jumps, pain fires through Anthony’s body.

Anthony now stands inside the elevator, rapidly slapping the button, beseeching the elevator to make with haste to the bottom floor.

Anthony’s eyes water and his hands hold his crotch as the doors to the elevator begin to slide shut.

“Oh, hold the elevator,” a voice calls.

Notice how Anthony leaps from fear. Running towards him is a rather attractive woman. Anthony’s mind cycles through alternative courses of action. He could allow the door to close and make his way to the gas station sooner. Plus, without this new arrival slowing him down, Anthony was free to make whatever fidgety movements he wished. But Anthony’s conscience caught up with him and his hand flew in front of the doors.

“Thanks,” the newcomer panted as she staggered past Anthony into the elevator. The doors slid closed, and the elevator descended.

Observe how Anthony bounces in place. He is casually shuffling his knees. Notice how his hands twitch at his sides. Anthony is doing everything in his power to keep from grabbing himself or squirming around. Either of which would be highly embarrassing to do in front of a complete stranger.

In Anthony’s urgent mind, the elevator’s climb down to the lobby feels as if it is taking forever.

Anthony’s elevator companion is casually playing on her cell phone, just scrolling social media. She hasn’t a clue to the predicament Anthony is in, and he hopes it stays that way.

Finally, the doors roll open and the woman casually strolls away. Anthony rushes towards the lobby. He does not intend to run indoors, but Anthony’s growing need forces his feet to - against his will - move in great strides. Notice how beads of sweat form on the young man’s face and his eyes grow wilder with each second his bladder expands past its limit.

Anthony zips through the double doors and dashes towards his car. The drive to the gas station is two blocks away. Anthony must act quickly or risk a embarrassment.

Anthony finally reaches his car. He grasps the door handle and pulls, driven to rage by his swollen bladder. Anthony finds the door locked. He shuffles around his jeans only to make a second, much more horrible discovery… He left his keys upstairs. Anthony’s car keys have been left in his hotel room.

Cursing, Anthony makes his way bath through the lobby. As we monitor Anthony’s movements, notice as his head shifts around his shoulders, glaring the length of the lobby. Anthony realizes no one is aware of his situation, as they all carry about their own business. This realization gives the slightest bit of joy to the desperate man.

Anthony crashes into the elevator and pounds the button to take him back to his room. The doors close and Anthony is alone. Pay attention to the way Anthony’s feet swerve around below him and the way he grasps the bulge of his penis through his jeans. These are sure fire signs to tell us that Anthony’s urinary urge has gone from bad to worse and soon it may be too late.

The elevator doors open with a satisfying ding and Anthony rushes back to his hotel room. He finally makes it, only to make yet another discovery, this one worse than the last two… Not only did Anthony leave his car keys inside the hotel room… But he also left his room key, the key card to open his hotel room.

Cursing and kicking his feet in the air, Anthony grabs his door handle and tugs as if his life is at stake. The door remains firmly locked. In pure desperation, Anthony had left his hotel room without grabbing his car keys or his key card. Now, Anthony is locked out of both his car and his hotel room. Worse yet, Anthony’s urge is at a solid eight out of ten now and rapidly growing.

As you will see, Anthony’s head falls against the silver door and he grabs his penis, shuffling it around and squeezing it, knowing full well his penis is all that stands between him and an accident.

Anthony will have to worry about his key card later. Right now, he had to empty his full tank. As difficult as this would be to accomplish, Anthony only saw one real option… He would have to walk to the gas station. It was only two blocks away. That should not be too hard. But having an extra full bladder, as Anthony now understood, makes even the simplistic tasks like pulling teeth with toothpicks.

Grunting out his frustration, Anthony turns on his heels and marches back towards the elevator. Having to ride the elevator a third time in the same hour, Anthony shifts his penis around inside his jeans, having the privacy of an elevator all to himself.

Anthony chews his lip and moans quietly, feeling his desperation rise to a nine. The doors open and Anthony is forced to regain his posture. As you will notice, Anthony is making movements between a jog and a waddle. Anthony must move quickly, but separating his legs, even for a moment may prove to be fatal for him.

Anthony is nearly at the door when a voice calls, “Are you okay, sir?”

Anthony angrily turns. Suppressing his wrath, he says as calmly as possible, “I am fine.”

Standing behind him is a hotel staff member who has a worried look on his face. “I just saw you pass through the lobby like three times,” the man began. “I just wondered…”

“I am fine,” Anthony repeats and brushing away the conversation, pushes past the doors and speed walks down the street.

As you can tell, the streets are mostly empty. A car passes by every now and again, but no real activity at these early evening hours. This allows our desperate friend to grab and squeeze and adjust his penis as much as he likes.

Observe how Anthony keeps both hands clasped over his penis bulge, one over the other. Anthony shuffles along, moving at a brisk pace, but careful not to move too fast and upset his already furious urinary bladder. Speaking of bladders and bulges, as you will witness, jugging several inches from Anthony’s waistband comes a bladder so large, it looks the size of the setting sun. Sweat trickles down Anthony’s tensed up features as his need grows worse than ever before.

Anthony is constantly scanning alleyways, debating finding a relief in one of them. But Anthony - a model citizen - refuses to urinate in a residential area such as this. Besides, police or someone else may see him. And so, Anthony pushes away the fantasy of catching some relief in an alleyway and continues to trudge on.

The walk is long. The summer air only makes Anthony’s bladder feel even warmer and sweatier than it already is. Sweat pushes down Anthony’s bladder bulge like small rivers. Anthony’s bladder is incredibly hot as if it is filled with molten lava. Anthony’s bladder feels heavy as well. As if our poor friend is dragging around a bowling ball inside. The pressure has mostly migrated to Anthony’s penis by now. The head of Anthony’s penis is throbbing, pulsating, and quivering, begging for release. Anthony pushes past the pain and continues down the road.

The man - now at a nine point five desperation level - has the gas station in sight. He can feel the relief! So close, yet so far. Anthony normally did his best to avoid gas station restrooms but having held this in for almost nine hours and having had a lot of coffee to drink, Anthony could safely say that this was an emergency.

Turn your attention to Anthony’s hands. Even as they hold his mighty manhood, they twitch and shake. Anthony has made a very common mistake when it comes to holding your crotch in a desperate situation… He has given his crotch extra strength at the beginning. And while that helped Anthony get to this point, he has been holding so long now, his hands have grown tired and now ache in protest. Anthony silently begs his hands to hold on a little longer.

Anthony stumbles across the street and into the gas station.

Anthony can finally see the bathrooms. Notice how his eyes grow and begin to weep with joy. Anthony can feel relief getting closer and closer.

“Excuse me, sir,” the man from the cash register calls. “You must buy something in order to use our bathrooms.”

Watch as Anthony’s features switch from excitement at the possibility of relief to irritation at this store worker.

“Can I buy something on the way out,” Anthony pleads. “I really have to go!” Anthony can feel his cheeks fill with blood at saying this, but it is just he and the cash register. Perhaps if the cash register knows Anthony’s urgency he will comply.

“I am sorry, sir,” replies the worker. “But it is store policy. You must buy something first.”

Pay attention to the way Anthony’s legs tremble like fruit in a blender. Anthony’s feet throb and his legs pound, protesting having to hold up Anthony’s desperate body for so long. The walk here only increased Anthony’s frantic desperate urges. Anthony feared he would not be able to wait one more second. Nor would he be able to reach the cash register without leaking.

“Just give me a bag of chips,” Anthony said, urgency filling his tone. “I’m sorry… But I can’t wait! I promise I will pay when I come back out, but right now…” As you can see, Anthony’s legs are crossed like a shoelace, squeezing his lower half tight. Anthony’s hands tremble as he covers his crotch.

Look at how the cashier watches our desperate subject. The man’s eyes fill with concern and understanding, and his facial features soften. He gives Anthony an understanding nod and rings up one bag of chips.

Anthony gives the man a look of thanks, then dashes into the restroom. Anthony freezes in place and moans. He can feel his hands get warm. Anthony’s worst fear is starting. A thick, metal hot, jet of pee explodes from the tip of Anthony’s penis. The dark spot is hardly visible, but Anthony can certainly feel the warmth spread along the fabric of his undergarments. Doubling over in a last stitch effort to hold on, Anthony huffs under his breath, staggering - like a drunk - the last few feet until he is face to face with the urinal.

Anthony is clenching his sphincter muscles tighter than ever. But poor Anthony can feel a tidal wave of pressure pushing down on his sphincter. The same way a person feels having to carry around boxes stuffed with bricks. Anthony could feel another squirt starting.

In a frenzy, Anthony tears down his zipper and yanks open his belt. Observe how Anthony does all of this at a quick pace. He is moving as swiftly as possible. You will also notice that Anthony keeps hopping from foot to foot. His feet are taking turns holding up the weight of his bursting full bladder.

Watch as Anthony shoves a hand violently into his trousers and begins pulling and tugging around. Anthony rips his penis through the fly of his boxers and out the second fly, this one belonging to his jeans.

Anthony holds his penis with one hand and a torrent of piss erupts from it. You will notice that Anthony rests his opposite hand against the wall and tilts his head forward. Look at Anthony’s mouth. You will see saliva stuck on the upper and lower lips, making a spider web of spit along his teeth and gums.

Now pay attention to Anthony’s penis. You will see how the limp genitalia is thrashing around, sort of like a fish out of water or an out-of-control garden hose. Anthony keeps a steady - yet slightly shaky hand - grasped firmly over the shaft. Now zoom in on the urine flying from Anthony’s cock. The urine splatters the back of the urinal, moving in giant waves that would drown a city of ants. Anthony douses the bubblegum pink urinal cake in a shower of golden liquid. The back of the urinal is now completely painted in gold. You will see how Anthony’s urine is mostly clear. This is a reminder of all the coffee he has consumed earlier. The urinal is now soaked in urine. There is even a dribble running over the side like a waterfall to the floor.

Anthony can feel the urine moving swiftly from his shaft into the urinal bowl. His bladder is evacuating urine at an incredibly fast rate. Anthony can feel his water level go down as his insides relax and so does his outsides. Anthony’s hands - while still stinging - feel loads better. The pressure on Anthony’s penis has gone down so much, Anthony hardly remembers it was ever there. Anthony breaths, relaxing himself to the best of his ability. Even Anthony’s bowling ball sized bladder has shrunk down and will soon vanish from sight.

Anthony stands before the urinal bowl, penis in hand, and feels at total peace.

After several long moments of standing there, Anthony’s torrential downstorm of piss subsides. Observe how Anthony gives a small push to his pelvis to eject the final stream of urine that had gotten stuck at some point of exit. The last of the piss falls into the urinal and Anthony’s penis is now dripping with the aftermath of urination. You will see how these tiny streams of urine run from Anthony’s urethral opening down the length of the head of his penis. Anthony gives his member a few good hard shakes, sending the last dribbles of urine flying from his manhood’s tip, straight down into the urinal.

Anthony retucks his member and is satisfied that the drops his bladder spilled into his boxers have dried by now. Anthony zips up and rebuckles his belt. After washing his hands properly, Anthony leaves the bathroom feeling much better than when he entered. All the pressure was gone and Anthony smiled.

Once again, thank you for joining us on this expedition into male desperation. Take care and remember to keep your bladder full. Bye!
