Mike and Jane's Roleplaying Pee

Here is yet another installment to this series. Hope you enjoy!

Jane carefully placed her golden laurel wreath on her head. She placed dangling golden earrings inside her ears and adjusted her golden belt around the waist of her toga. Jane also wore a golden necklace and golden bracelets to match. Meanwhile, Mike finished setting up his loin cloth around his entire waist.

“You ready?” Jane asked her husband, all the while feeling herself fill with enthusiasm and arousal. Mike looked good in a loincloth. Jane’s favorite activities were any that involved seeing her husband nearly naked.

“Sure am,” Mike said. “Your bladder ready?”

Jane placed her leg up against her pee hole and chewed her lower lip. “Oh, yeah, it’s full!” Jane agreed.

“Safe word?”

“Yoga.”

“Good,” Mike said. “Let’s do this!”

The handsome mortal man sat in his bedroom, using a chamber pot for a toilet. His penis dangled against the metal bowl, squirting out a powerful jet of semi-transparent piss. A smile came to the handsome mortal’s face as he cheerfully drained his bladder into the pot. Just as the mortal was finishing up, a blinding golden light flooded the room. The light faded and standing there with her legs tightly crossed was the most attractive woman the mortal has ever seen.

One look at her in her toga and covered with gold, her gorgeous features, and the mortal instantly knew that she was a beautiful, all powerful Greek goddess. Appearing in a flash of gold should have told the mortal that.

The mortal blushed, fearing the divine would notice his limp penis. The mortal quickly tucked his penis into the folds of his loincloth and tucked his chamber pot underneath his bed, its contents sloshing outside the bowl some as he hid the overflowing metal container.

“My lady,” the respectful mortal bowed.

“Mortal,” the goddess did a mini dance.

“I… I apologize, ma’am,” the mortal said. “I did not intend for you to see…”

“Oh, never mind that, mortal,” the goddess hissed. “I come before you today as I am in dire need of your assistance.”

The mortal fell back. “M… My assistance, ma’am?”

The goddess nodded. “I have been watching you for some time. You are a very kind, handsome, intellectual, and well-rounded mortal. I knew if I ever got into a predicament, you would help me.”

“I certainly will, ma’am,” the mortal bowed again. “Whatever can I do for you today?”

“Well…” The goddess slammed her eyes closed and bit her teeth all the way into her lip as a massive wave of urgency washed over her immortal body. The goddess couldn’t even remember the last time her bladder had been so uncomfortable. “To tell you the truth,” she tapped her foot. “I must piss.”

The mortal flinched. “You…”

“Yes, yes,” the goddess grunted. She wrapped her legs as tight as a bow and squeezed them against her abdomen using her hands. “It is hilarious, I know. An all-powerful Greek goddess bursting for a piss.”

“No, no, no, no, ma’am,” the mortal waved his hands from side to side. “I didn’t mean…”

“Forget it,” the goddess spat, banging her foot hard against the stone floor. “I know this is awkward for you as it is I, however, I do not know where else to turn. All of the bathrooms on Olympus are either broken or occupied. And I can no longer wait. As I said, I have watched you and know what a smart, resourceful, kind mortal you are. I beg of you to find me a place to alleviate my godly needs. Do this and you shall be greatly rewarded.”

“Y… yes, my lady,” the mortal spit forth. “I know…” the mortal reached under his bed and produced his overflowing chamber pot. “Granted, we will need to dump this, but how about you use this, my lady?” The mortal asked. “I use this myself all day.”

The goddess looked over the small pot presented to her. She shook her head, allowing her mop of ink colored hair to flop around her shoulders. “I am a goddess,” she hissed. “I cannot piss in that! I refuse! I need a proper place to urinate. A place fit for a goddess’ piss!”

“Ma’am, with all due respect,” the mortal ventured. He looked the goddess over, watching her stumble around, grasping her goddesshood. “It does not look like you can keep it in another moment,” the mortal warned. “I suggest you don’t act picky and use this.”

“I am not picky,” the goddess bellowed. “I am a goddess! I will not piss into that ugly thing! That piece of porcelain is not worthy to contain my godly waters! I shall have a proper place to urinate or else…” She let her threat hang in the air.

“Okay, okay,” the mortal put the chamber pot back. “I’ll think of something else.”

“I apologize for my outburst,” the goddess sighed. “I am just used to toilets made of gold, latrines shining with light. That is what they look like on Mount Olympus. I did not mean to snap. It just hurts…” The goddess winced as she squeezed her leg even deeper into her all-powerful vulva. “Besides, have you ever seen a goddess piss? Our bladders can hold infinite amounts. That pot would never in a million millennia contain all the liquid I am currently holding.

Please find me a more appropriate place to release my nectar…” The goddess begged.

The mortal tapped his sharp chin. “Let’s see here,” the mortal said to himself. “If I was a goddess, where would I like to pee…”

“In the bathrooms on Olympus, but I can’t…” Tears came to the immortal’s eyes.

“How about outside?” The mortal asked. “I live on a farm, so there is lots of privacy?”

“No, I am a goddess. I shall not piddle in the grass no matter how much privacy there is, how desperate I am… I demand a proper place to…”

“How about my crates? I own a lot of crates of food. I can empty them, and you can…”

“I shall not pass my golden waste into a wooden crate,” the goddess fizzed through grit teeth. “I need…”

“I know, I know, a proper place,” the mortal said. “The only one I can think of it the toilet…”

The goddess’ face lit up red. “YOU HAVE A TOILET AND YOU ARE TELLING ME TO PISS IN ALL OF THESE INAPPROPRIATE…”

“Ma’am, that ‘toilet’ in question is a long ways from here,” the mortal interrupted the goddess’ rant. “And it is in the path of many monsters and dangerous beasts.”

“Oh,” the goddess blushed. “Sorry. I suppose that is a good reason to be hesitant. With that said, I badly need a piss. If you will guide me to this toilet, I would be forever grateful, and you shall be rewarded.”

“Okay, then,” the mortal grabbed his sword and shield off the wall. “It will be dangerous. But we shall do it. Let’s go.”

“Okay,” the mortal said. “Behold my goddess, the first danger in our journey to the latrine… The lengthy staircase!”

Jane the goddess looked down the concrete stairs (which in her head, she pretended were stone). “It does not seem so bad,” the goddess said. But even as she said this, her bladder protested. The goddess feared taking one more step with her bladder in its current condition. She was unsure if she would be able to last while descending this dangerous staircase.

“I am afraid that is only half the danger, my lady,” the mortal muttered. “At the bottom of the lengthy staircase is a furious monster.”

Suddenly, the chamber pot didn’t seem so bad to the goddess. But her pride forced her to push forward. “Let us descend,” the goddess swallowed and took a shaking step onto the top step.

The mortal took the goddess’ hand and together, they slowly climbed down the steps. The mortal led the goddess down each stair, one at a time. The duo were nearly halfway down. The goddess could feel her bladder sloshing violently in her pelvis. She feared its doom was inevitable. Each step taken added waves of pressure onto the goddess’ bladder. The goddess had to clench every last muscle she had in order to keep the flood at bay. Each time she lifted her leg, she felt her bladder squeeze. And each time she lowered her leg, she felt her bladder contract. It was an endlessly painful cycle.

They were nearly there. Only a few final steps. The goddess sucked on her lower lip. The goddess’ bladder quaked and she felt her godly panties turn damp as she let out only a single drop. The goddess - still holding the mortal’s strong hand for support - took her other hand and wedged it firmly into her toga. She was unsure how much more she could take.

At long last, the mortal guided the goddess to the floor.

“Here we are,” he said.

“Thank the gods,” the goddess moaned. “Where is this bathroom you speak of?”

“I am afraid it is a bit farther, my lady.”

The goddess cursed under her breath.

Suddenly, there was a violent roar, a roar so strong, the goddess felt another small dribble escape her. Blocking the path was a ferocious dragon. The beast reared its head and spit a trail of fire at the duo.

As quick as lightning, the mortal raised his sparkling shield and the flames ricocheted off the surface and vanished in midair.

“Ha, you demon, you will have to do better than that!” the mortal charged, sword raised, a hungry look in his eyes.

The dragon blasted more fire. The mortal rolled to his side. The dragon thrashed its tail. The mortal leapt from the ground onto the back of the scaly beast.

The goddess knew she had to help her new mortal companion in some way. Normally, she would just use her unlimited powers to vanquish the beast. But as it was, she could hardly remove her hands from her crotch without squirting. That was it!

“Mortal man,” the goddess called. “Get it to open its mouth!”

The mortal nodded his understanding. The mortal kicked the dragon’s head and leapt off. The mortal rolled through the air and landed besides the goddess once more. The vicious beast opened its jaw, preparing to dose the pair in his flames. But the goddess had a plan. She would dose this creature in something else!

The goddess lifted her toga, pulled her frilly pink panties to one side, and let loose. The goddess’ godly stream was so powerful that it blasted down the dragon’s mouth. The dragon choked and gagged. The goddess shut down her powerful torrent of piss and looked the dragon in its golden eyes. The dragon reared its head and prepared to launch more fire at the explorers. But all that came out was urine.

“Nice shot, my lady,” the mortal wailed. “Now that you blasted your godly liquids into the beast, it can no longer breathe fire. Only urine.”

The goddess pursed her lips. “A urine breathing dragon… Quite odd, isn’t it?”

“Personally, I would prefer urine over fire,” the handsome mortal said.

“As would I,” the goddess admitted. “All though, right now…” The goddess’ knees trembled, and she squeezed her legs closed.

“Oh, of course, how do you feel?” the mortal asked, worry in his voice.

“Worse,” the goddess moaned. “Letting out that little bit of pee is making it much harder to hold.” The goddess fixed her panties and toga and grasped her goddesshood as if her life was on the line.

“I am so sorry, my lady,” the mortal apologized. “Thank you for saving me. Now, I shall get you to a toilet or die trying! Let us proceed!”

Mike and Jane glared down at their rather old dog sleeping soundly at the bottom of the stairs. A few inches from him was a very small puddle of pee that Jane let out onto the hardwood floor.

“Sorry, buddy,” Jane apologized. “I would bend down to pet you, but if I do, my bladder will burst!”

“Why apologize?” Mike asked. “We didn’t do anything to him. We just pretended he was a dragon. I only pretended to fight him.”

“Yeah, but I peed on the floor near him,” Jane said. “Plus, I feel bad for roping him into our weird game.”

The dog stood, stretched, turned over, and went back to sleep.

“I don’t think he minds,” Mike said in a voice that forced Jane to laugh. Jane felt her bladder fill with pressure from her laughter. Jane grunted, grasping herself tightly for real. Mike gently took both of his wife’s elbows in his hands and said sweetly, “Come on, my goddess. Let us get you to a bathroom.”

Jane smiled. Mike walked towards the patio door. Her bladder extra full, Jane was forced to waddle.

The mortal and goddess, having slayed the dragon, managed to make their way down a very long path and to a large stone door.

“We must solve the riddles imprinted on this door to continue,” the mortal explained.

“Well, please hurry,” the goddess whimpered, bouncing up and down. “I must take a leak, my mortal. It is quite urgent indeed…”

“I will try,” the mortal examined the door. “First riddle… What does Medusa and my wife’s breasts have in common?” The mortal ran his fingers along his chin, deep in thought. “Medusa and my wife’s breasts…”

“Hurry, my mortal…” the goddess moaned, feeling a strong wave wash over her.

“Well, they both turn me to stone,” the mortal chuckled. The mortal was highly impressed with himself when he noticed the words on the stone door vanish and be replaced with the second riddle. “Riddle number two,” the mortal said. “What does Poseidon and a urinary sphincter have in common? Huh, that’s a tough one. Let’s see here… Poseidon is the god of the sea.”

“Hurry this up, mortal, please,” the goddess implored. “I must release my waters soon!”

“That’s it,” the mortal snapped his fingers. “Poseidon and a urinary sphincter both control an ocean!” The second riddle vanished and there was a third.

“Okay, last one, I think,” the mortal said. “Hang in there, my lady.”

“Just please hurry…”

“Okay, how was the birth of Orion the hunter similar to that of a toilet?” The mortal pondered this. “I remember that story,” he thought aloud. “It was said that Orion was born when three gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hermes filled a dead bull carcass up with their urine. That’s it! The gods used the bull as a toilet to birth Orion!”

The final riddle dissolved, and the stone door rolled open.

Mike pulled open the sliding patio door, a large piece of paper with riddles on it swayed in the fresh breeze as Mike led a desperate Jane out to their backyard. The duo looked at their shed and smiled at one another.

The couple began to carefully walk from the patio door through a large pile of plastic snakes sprinkled across the yard.

“Beware of the field of snakes,” the mortal cried.

The goddess yelped, feeling a slight trickle sting her pee hole as it shot out into her cotton panties.

The mortal rushed through the field out snakes, slicing them apart with his sword, pushing them to the side with his shield, stopping them with his feet, clearing the way for the goddess.

“Be warned, my lady,” the mortal kicked a snake away and then punched another with his shield. “These vipers are poisonous.”

“Terrific,” the goddess hissed, feeling another strong wave crush her bladder.

They made it past the field of vapers and down a short hill.

“The grass grows wildly here,” the mortal sliced through a tall thicket with his sword. The mortal stumbled as a large blade of grass wrapped around his foot. The mortal sliced through it and kept going. “They say that the grass is living and grows only to squeeze the life of any who cross its path.”

The goddess groaned. The goddess was forced to stumble forward. She couldn’t waddle out of fear of the living grass catching up to her. But she also couldn’t run due to the heaviness of her pee pouch. The goddess could feel another wave of utter desperation fast approaching. She knew that not even the strength of her godly bladder was enough to keep in her liquids much longer.

The goddess felt a large shadow passing over her. The goddess craned her neck to the sky and let out a screech. The largest blade of grass she had ever seen shot down from the heavens and laced itself tightly around the goddess’ swollen tummy. The goddess shouted and thrashed. This only added to the discomfort of her already highly pressurized bladder. The grass grew around the goddess’ stomach and pressed down on her overflowing bag of hot liquid. The goddess felt an involuntary squirt shot from her vulva and dampen her panties farther. The goddess moaned, using the last of her straight to hold. She could no longer kick or squirm in the grass’ clutches. The goddess knew that the next movement she made would surely cause her tired sphincter to fail her.

In the real world, Jane pushed down as hard as possible into her very large bladder, using both fists. Jane dubbed over, moaning. She didn’t hold back. She pushed down into her own bladder with all the strength she had. She could feel her bladder quake from the added pressure, it was seriously close to expelling all of its contents in a matter of seconds. This while Mike swung his plastic sword at imaginary grass.

The mortal charged in; sword raised. In one swift slice, the mortal had freed the goddess. The grass began to retreat.

“Are you okay, my lady?” The mortal asked.

The goddess was in full on tears. She hobbled over, hands in genitalia, her toga folded at the sides. The goddess was well aware that her panties were slightly visible through her wrinkled toga, but she didn’t care.

“That damned plant put extra pressure down on my… OH!” The goddess shouted. She felt a strong squirt, the stronger yet fly forth from her pee hole and cause a gray patch to form on the crotch on her panties. The goddess, with much difficulty, managed to stem the flow. The goddess cursed and moaned. “I must piss, my mortal,” the goddess insisted. “I MUST PISS NOOOOOOWW!!!”

The mortal had a look of terror upon his face, well aware now that even this goddess had her limits. Before today, the mortal wasn’t even sure if gods went to the bathroom. Minus that story about Orion’s birth - and even that one is debated - there are no real stories about gods using the restroom. But now the handsome mortal knew that gods don’t only use the bathroom like mortals, but they also get desperate. The gods were much like mortals in that way. Even if the gods’ limits were higher than their mortal counterparts, the gods had limits nonetheless. And this poor desperate goddess has far surpassed hers.

“Come, my lady,” the mortal grasped the goddess’ hand and tugged her a few more feet. The goddess stumbled, but then came to a halt. She stood dubbed over, her massive bladder stretching from her skin. “Only a little farther,” the mortal promised.

“No… I cannot make it…” The goddess moaned. “It is like holding up the sky. There is simply too much pressure… I cannot… OH!” Another strong squirt fired into the goddess’ lacy undies. This was it! The goddess knew she was on the verge of an accident. “I must pee…” The goddess let a trickle escape. Then a squirt. Then a few more dribbles. It was pointless to hold back. The flood gates were opening one way or another…

“NO!” the mortal wailed. The mortal lunged forwards. In his strong arms, he hosted up the goddess, carrying both her and her massive bladder weight.

“Hold it in, my lady,” the mortal said. “We are almost there!”

The mortal sprinted as fast as he could. He stomped over a small creek. The goddess shifted a heavy moan as she grasped her lady bits and trembled with urgency. Bits of cool creek water splashed around the goddess’ bare legs and sandals. She cursed, but kept holding on.

The mortal dashed across the field and finally closed in on the shed that houses the toilet. The mortal closed in on the shed. He gently lowered the goddess to the ground and used his sword to slash the locks off of the shed. He then took the goddess in his arms again and carried her inside.

“Toilet, toilet, toilet, toilet…” was all the goddess said, as she squeezed everything she had, sensing her chance to stay dry was quickly running out. The goddess subconsciously adjusted the golden belt on her waist, regretting having decided to wear it this morning.

“We are almost there, my lady,” the mortal promised.

The mortal glanced down. In his arms he held a shivering goddess who kept her hands down deep inside her toga. Beads of sweat dotted her face. Her skin hummed a faint red hue. The goddess’ muscles were shaking involuntarily. The goddess looked ready to be sick. Worst of all, the mortal noticed the goddess’ bladder bulge. It was hard to miss it. The goddess’ bladder stuck out several inches from her body. The goddess had her toga pulled so far up, that none of it covered the mountain that was her bladder. Sweat ran along her exposed bladder.

The mortal spotted a tiny droplet of sweat fall down into the goddess’ belly button. The goddess’ bladder bulge was kind of sexy… The mortal scolded himself for thinking of the divine in such a manner. But he could not help it. Just holding the goddess so close, the mortal could feel the intense heat her filled up bladder radiated. The mortal could even hear the swishing of urine splashing around inside the goddess’ pee filled organ. The mortal felt his manhood stipend in the folds of his loincloth. The mortal again chided himself again. But he could not help this either. His penis was so hard, the mortal felt he could use it in place of his axe.

“If I may, my lady,” the mortal said. “That is some bladder bulge you have. It is enormous!” The mortal grunted at himself. Why did he say that? That was so inappropriate to say to a goddess!

“Thank you,” the goddess managed. “I would like to drain it now…”

“In a moment,” the mortal promised.

“I do not have that long…”

“Hang in there, my lady,” the mortal at long last reached a shining toilet, standing alone in the center of the chamber. The mortal set the goddess back to the floor.

The goddess quickly tugged off her panties. The weight of her bladder was too much and the goddess ended up falling backwards onto the seat of the toilet.

The second the royal goddess sat her beautiful butt cheeks upon her throne, the storm was unleashed. The goddess let out a heavy moan. The sound of the goddess’ urination filled the entire shed. The sound was as loud as a thunderstorm against the flat rocks of a raging river. The sound was never ending. It was much louder than anything the mortal had ever heard before. The sound blasted from the goddess’ cooch. The goddess could feel her entire pee hole expand and sting with the pressure of gallons of nectar she drank that gushed out all at once. The goddess’ urethral opening was the literal size of a golden drachma. The goddess sweated and panted as she released every drop of liquid she had been storing for so long.

The goddess didn’t care that her underwear was badly spotted. Nor did she care that this mortal was watching her with wide eyes. All she cared about was heavenly relief! Relief fit for a goddess!

The goddess had finally calmed down. She sat back on the toilet and allowed her bladder to do its thing. As scorching hot piss blasted from in between her labia, the goddess noticed her mortal companion had something poking from his loincloth. And she knew what it was.

“I apologize for this, my mortal,” the goddess said.

“It… No problem… I mean…” The mortal choked on his words. “Should I look away?”

“That is not necessary,” the goddess looked down. She returned her gaze upon the mortal who saved her bladder. “Are you aroused by this?” The goddess asked. “And do not bother to lie. Your genitals already gave it away.”

The mortal looked down and bit his lip. He quickly used his hands to hide his situation from view of the divine. “I… Umm…” The mortal knew the goddess was correct. It was pointless to lie. She had already seen it all. “Yes, ma’am, I am sorry.” The mortal held his head.

“Do not be,” the goddess said simply. “I am very grateful to you for bringing me here in time. You battled a dragon, living grass, snakes… You even carried me. I am forever grateful to you. If not for your heroic efforts, sir,” the goddess placed a hand underneath her underwear and held them up to better admire the gray stains. “I fear this would have been much, much worse. And I meant what I said. I shall give you a reward.” “And that reward, shall be…” the goddess grinned. “How would you like to have sex with the divine?”

The mortal’s eyes grew in surprise. “My… My lady…”

“You have earned it,” the goddess stated. “Plus, it would be a shame to waste such a perfectly good erection. Wouldn’t you agree?” The goddess’ stream was still pounding against the porcelain, but it was much quieter than when it originally started. “What do you say, my mortal? Do you wish to make love to a divine goddess such as myself?”

The mortal smiled and nodded. The goddess soon finished and wiped herself with a sheet of toilet paper that hung off the wall. Her earrings dangled and clattered as she moved about. The mortal absolutely adored watching the goddess’ vaginal lips flap in the air as she moved the paper across them. The mortal felt overjoyed that he would see more of them!

“Okay,” the goddess stood and picked up her panties. She rolled her palms across her knee-high toga, flattening out the wrinkles. “I am ready. You? Mortal?”

The mortal man shuffled from foot to foot. “I am ready as well, ma’am. But first, I request…”

“To use the toilet?” The goddess giggled, stepping aside.

“Yes, please…”

Mike and Jane lay on the shed floor in front of the fake toilet they installed. (It was really just a large hollow pipe with a toilet seat on top). The two lay in the dark naked and panting.

“No wonder the goddess went to you for help,” Jane told her husband, rubbing his chest hair. “You are brave, kind, resourceful, smart, handsome, and great at sex!”

Mike snickered. “Anything for my goddess.” He held Jane tight in his arms. “And I can’t wait for our next role playing pee game!”

“Neither can I,” Jane lifted herself off the ground and stood up on her elbows above Mike, looking down at his truly handsome face. Jane then slowly lowered herself back down and gave her husband a soft yet passionate kiss. “How does it feel having sex with a goddess?”

Mike gave a thumbs-up. “The best.”

Here is the next story in this series! Enjoy! 🙂

Jane sat at a desk in the office of the house. She was dressed all in red with some streaks of yellow making her look like a racing car. Jane adjusted her helmet with one hand. Her legs looked like a trembling bow tie under her desk. Jane’s free hand was sliding around a piece of paper, waving the pen around as though it were a baton. Her messy handwriting was even messier as she squirmed under the freshly polished desk. Her chair cracked under her. Jane chewed her lip as she wrote up the report.

Despite how frantic her need was, Jane’s spirit was bounding around her insides as if her boss just told her she had a month off with pay, but she didn’t want to seem too eager in front of her. Jane was ecstatic to do this with Mike again! She could instantly tell this would be epic!

Jane had to properly get into character. She took a breath and reminded herself that she was no longer Jane. She was now the chief of the fire department. She was busy working on a report, but she desperately needed the washroom and refused to leave. Still, it was hard to concentrate on work when her ureters were dumping urine into her bladder like twin sewage pipes draining water into the ocean.

The chief needed the lavatory quite urgently.

Bring, Bring. Bring, Bring, rang the office phone on the desk beside her.

Struggling to remain still, the chief adjusted her boobs - which weer too big for her tight uniform - and picked up the phone and held it to her ear canal. “Chief of the fire department,” she said in a voice that suggested she was sitting through a boring college lecture. “State your name and emergency.”

“Hi, my name is Mike and I’m a helpless citizen,” said the voice on the other end. “My room is burning down! Please send help!”

“On our way,” the chief hung up. She stood, feeling a pound of pressure go straight to her gut. She paraded her legs up and down as if she were in a marching band. Jane knew she should stop at the toilet, but that poor helpless citizen was having an emergency. (So was the chief, though. The chief was having a big, wet emergency here!) Nevertheless, it was her duty as chief of the firefighting department to help this man. She could wait. She had to wait!

Dancing from her office, the chief went to gather the firefighters only to notice the place as empty as a Steakhouse in a town full of vegetarians. It appeared as if the rest of the department had gone to the beach. It was a nice day. Perfect for surfing. The very thought caused the chief to grip herself, feeling a large teardrop of urine bubble up against the opening to her pee tube.

It looked like the chief was on her own.

Mike the terrified citizen screamed and yelped as a (fake) fire (made of construction paper) blazed down his bedroom. The yellow, red, and orange flames spread as quickly as a virus in a packed stadium. They engulfed the entire room in their flaring trail.

The fire woman appeared on the scene. Legs crossed and knees knit, the fire chief glared upon the inferno before her. She carried with her a long hose (actually a spray bottle) from the (imaginary) fire truck.

Most people might be scared to face down a fire. Most may have an accident in their pants at the thought. But this was what the chief trained for. This was what she did. She was as nervous as a lion pouncing on a mouse.

“Sir, I’m gonna need you to stand back,” the chief ordered.

The citizen reluctantly turned and hid behind the chief as if she were the walls defending a castle.

The chief could feel her bladder ball up and rock side to side inside her pelvis. She bared her teeth like a crazed gorilla and aimed the hose. She sprayed.

Gallons of freezing water issued from the entrance to the hose and gushed towards the burning room before her. Watching the water rush out made the chief tempted to release water from her own hose! But she clamped her muscles, shutting off her tube, and squinted in agony. Watching the water fly, listening to it burst forward, made her bladder do summersaults. Just holding this hose, feeling the water blast through the rubber, made her bladder sweat and pant heavily. The chief felt like she was holding a giant’s penis as he peed. The sound and sight of water were a dangerous combo with an obnoxiously full bladder.

Suddenly, the gigantic waterspout died down and disappeared back into the tube.

“Wut… What happened?” The citizen rasped.

“Damn thing,” the chief cursed, shaking the hose, sending out a weak trickle to the floor below her. “It must be out…”

The fire had mostly been washed away as was. But there were a few more small fires here and there and the chief knew they would soon spread and the hellish landscape would return. The chief had to act quickly. What else could she possibly use to put out the fire?

The chief stood there, thinking and thinking all the while very discreetly potty dancing, regretting not visiting the lavatory sooner. The chief didn’t want that type of water! She needed real…

That was it…

Urine was technically water. A distinct form of it anyway. The chief could put out the fire with her own pee!

She looked at the terrified citizen apologetically. “Sir, what I am about to do is unethical and unprofessional,” she said. “But it may save your room here. And it will solve another problem I have as well. It will be like killing two birds with one stone. Okay?”

The citizen stared down. He clearly noticed the fire department chief’s potty dance by now. The citizen looked up and nodded in understanding.

The chief turned and raced towards the flames. She lowered her white cotton panties, lifted her strawberry red skirt, and squatted several inches above the flames. Yet, she still felt her butt heat up like a car engine in summer. A half centimeter wide clear stream shot from the chief’s pussy down onto the flames. The firewoman was unable to help but moan in bliss as she felt her pee balloon slowly deflate inside.

The flames were forced to retreat as the chief’s piss made direct contact with them. Steam was exhausted from the connection and rose into the air, surrounding the chief’s face like a gray cloud. The steam soon vanished and more came up to replace it.

The chief pulled and tugged on her muscles, calling the stream to end. The chief felt her insides boil and her labia quiver as the stream was stopped. But the chief knew she had many more fires to put out.

The chief rushed around the room, drenching each set of flames in her golden nectar. The chief’s bladder voided little by little. The chief already felt a ton better.

Soon enough, the entire room was covered in urine and ash. But no hint of a fire anywhere.

Best of all, the chief felt relieved! She felt like one does after completing a ten page essay. Exhausted and ready to collapse, but grateful the pressure of doing the task was gone. And her internal pressure was indeed all gone!

The chief let loose her last small squirt upon the floor, tugged up her white panties, and flattened her skirt back in place.

The citizen raced forward, wrapping the chief in a hug as if she was an old friend he believed to have passed on.

“Thank you, ma’am, oh, that was brilliant!” The citizen cried. “You saved me! You saved me with your piss!”

“All in a day’s work,” the chief said proudly as she pulled her helmet down in a slight salute. “Now, if you will excuse me…” The chief turned her body, but before she could take a step…

“Oh, wait,” the citizen called. “I wish to thank you for your efforts.”

“Not necessary,” the chief replied. “All in a day’s work, my good sir.”

“No, please, I must…” insisted the citizen. “Now that you saved my bed,” he motioned accordingly. “What do you say I take you to it? Give you a proper ‘thank you’.”

The chief made a face as if he just suggested he would brush his teeth with battery acid. “Sir, that is highly inappropriate, don’t you think?” demanded the chief. “I am your fire department chief. I am here to serve and protect. But I will not, nor am I…”

“Come on, I think I could give you a swell time,” the citizen insisted, massaging her stomach through the uniform.

The chief blinked. She could not deny that this man was rather attractive. Nor could she dismiss her lust, her basic biological urge to take him as her own. If this citizen insisted on rewarding her, who was she to say no. Now that she thought of it, she had been working like a dog lately. The chief would quite like a break. Particularly one involving sexual intercourse.

“Very well,” the chief nodded. “Take my to your bed. But remember, this is a onetime deal. And no one may know.”

“I understand, ma’am,” the citizen gripped her hand and guided her towards his sheets.

Jane and Mike lay in bed panting as if they had just run all the way here from Saturn. Jane still wore her helmet. Other than that, the couple was fully nude. The covers held them down like a potato sack.

“That was nice,” Mike sighed.

“Yep,” Jane agreed, still feeling her clit vibrate.

“That was so sexy… Peeing on the fake fire, I mean,” Mike said. “Too bad it couldn’t be real, though. But don’t want to burn our house down for real!”

“Maybe when we go camping sometime,” Jane turned on her side to face her man.

“That’d be awesome,” Mike smiled, daydreaming of this already.

“Glad you enjoyed,” Jane giggled. “I like putting out fires.” Jane smirked, letting Mike comprehend the figurative meaning of her words.

“Can’t wait to see you put out fires again,” Mike whispered. The couple kissed.

Here is story number five! Enjoy! 🙂

The male patient sat on the examination table, his legs jiggling under him, his butt crinkling against the paper below him. The patient felt his bladder get to the size of a bowling ball. It was as heavy as one too. The patient had made sure to come in with a very full bladder. In retrospect, perhaps downing all of that water and waiting all day to pee was a bit excessive. Now, his bladder was pounding against his insides, desperate to release. The patient felt weighed down with water as if he were pregnant with a jug of freshly poured lemonade.

The patient had no idea how much longer he could stand this. His bladder was gnawing at his sphincter and his brain was running in circles, going crazy with all the unwanted pressure inside his body. The patient stared at the door, begging the doctor to arrive soon. It would be super awkward if she walked in and found a massive yellow puddle on her exam table.

Finally, as if someone had granted him a wish, the door to the exam room flipped open and a woman stepped inside. She was gorgeous with long dark hair and olive skin. She wore a sky blue undershirt and long pants. Over them was a lab coat and over that a stethoscope. She had white sneakers on and carried a clipboard. Her hair was pulled back in a long ponytail, making her appear sexier than normal.

The patient instantly realized something was off with his doctor. For one, she walked in an odd pattern. She kept her legs stuffed together and hobbled around as if her pants were filled with marbles. Also, she kept pressing herself against her crotch and even frequently held her clipboard tightly over her lengthy pants. Her facial muscles were tight as if she was stressed about something.

“How we doing today?” The doctor asked, her voice quivering a bit as she asked.

“Fine,” the patient replied.

“Good,” said Doctor, taking a seat on her stoll. “I see here that you need a urine sample today?”

“Yes.”

“Mind refreshing me on what for? I have a lot of patients, you know.”

“So, lately I have been feeling like I need to pee very urgently. And you wanted to me to take a urine test, just in case.”

“Very good. When did this start?” The doctor crossed her legs tight and held a pen to her clipboard, beginning to scribble down notes of the appointment.

“Last Friday, maybe.”

“I see, I see…” the doctor’s voice came out more as a moan. “How desperate would you say you are to pee at this moment?”

“Probably a nine…”

“Nine? Really?”

“Yeah… Well, to be fair, I had a lot to drink this morning and haven’t peed yet today.”

“When did you first wake up.”

“Three hours ago, I think.”

“And how much fluid did you consume?”

“Three water bottles this morning and a large Gatorade before bed.”

The doctor made more notes, her pen scratching violently against the clipboard, making a noise similar to that of long fingernails scraping against a wooden surface.

“Have you ever wet yourself?” The doctor asked.

“No.”

“Have you ever felt like you were close?”

“Yes.”

“When?”

“Right now for starters.”

The doctor couldn’t help but grin at her patience’s words as well as his desperate movements to hold back his urgent flood. The patient was rocking and swaying, grasping and holding, moaning and breathing. The doctor feared he would not last much longer. She also feared that she wouldn’t either. At a fault of poor judgment, the doctor drank an entire pot of coffee that morning and hasn’t had a single break yet. In that moment, she knew all about urgent needs!

The doctor knew she could not keep her patient waiting much longer. She would have to keep holding, but she also had to let him release his. This was tough for the doctor. Not only was she bursting full and was jealous that her patient would get to have a terrific pee in only moments, but the doctor was seriously into omorashi. She found nothing sexier than a cute dude struggling to hold his bladder. And this dude was cute!

But the doctor would remain professional. She would sacrifice both her needs of lust and of urinary urgency for her patience.

The doctor spun in her stool and yanked open a drawer (the nightstand they filled with doctor’s cups) behind her. She reached her hand in, objects rattling like maracas as she pushed them aside. The doctor pulled out a small plastic cup. There were no measurements on the side. But there was a sticky tab of paper pressed neatly on the front. The doctor speedily filled in her patient's information on the sheet.

The patient wanted to beg to do that last. He wanted to pee now! The patient now kept both hands against his crotch as he wiggled around on them like a bean bag chair.

Finally done with the information, the doctor handed the cup to her patient. “Unfortunately,” she said, flipping her ponytail back and holding her camel toe through her scrub’s pants. “The bathroom is flooded and out of order. That means you must pee here. Not to worry though. I shall leave and lock the door and…”

She was cut off by a sharp hissing noise. The patient had tore the lid off his cup and removed his penis from the fly of his jeans. He slapped his limp penis into the cup and a strong jet of piss shot from the tip.

The doctor’s eyes widened as if she just saw real life aliens abduct a barn full of cows. The doctor was shocked at this turn of events, sure. But it was her biggest fantasy to see a desperate man lose control and restore to the first option he saw. Sexual longing flooded the doctor’s mind just like her patient flooded his cup. But she quickly swept those feelings under the rug and composed her dignity.

“I’m sorry…” the patient sounded close to tears. “I could no longer wait…”

“It… It’s fine,” the doctor said soothingly. “These things happen…” The doctor’s voice trailed. She stared at her patient’s cup.

The level of yellow liquid was rising exponentially. Already, the piss level was at the halfway mark. Bubbles filled the top layer of urine as the volume of urine in the plastic grew. The pee had reached so far up the cup now, that the patient had to pull his penis back and dangle it over the roof of the cup in order to keep it from being submerged in its own fluid.

“I… I may need another one,” the patient said awkwardly.

“Those things are two hundred and fifty milliliters!” The doctor sounded in astonishment, holding her legs closed with one foot tapping against her other. “You did have to go, huh?”

“I sure did,” the patient exclaimed.

The doctor handed him another cup.

“I… I may need help…” the patient admitted.

The doctor felt herself blush. She had the opportunity to get even closer to her dream come true? Just barely keeping her muscles under control, the doctor stood and knelt beside her patient. She helped her patients no matter what. Whether it was at the cost of her own needs or extra awkward. She was happy to help. She just wished she needed need a leak as well!

The doctor opened the second cup and just like Indian Jones, they switched out the two cups quickly. The patient’s stream didn't even falter. He just kept spraying.

“Thanks… I couldn’t stop it for even a second…” The patient stated.

“No problem,” the doctor reassuringly patted his knee. “Like I said, these things happen.” Being so close to the source of the patient’s pee was torture for the doctor. The sound was amplified ten times from where she had sat on her stoll. The doctor now had a constant hisssssshhss sound in her ear, one she couldn’t shake. The doctor felt her bladder grow and grow with each drop of pee she heard hiss into the cup.

The patient handed his doctor his first cup. The doctor took it and capped it. Just holding it, she could see the cadmium yellow liquid glow in the light of the exam room. The warmth of the cup radiated on the doctor’s palm, making her hand sweat. She felt the warmth of the patient’s piss heat up her whole body like hot pool water in midsummer… including her bladder.

“I would say this is enough pee for your test,” the doctor said, giggling, trying to defuse the tension as well as her need by cracking a joke. It didn’t work.

The doctor could feel her bladder blast urine towards her sphincter like a canon. Her sphincter trembled but didn’t give. Another round of piss fired at the sphincter. It trembled even more, but held tight. By the time a third shot of golden water hit her sphincter, a leak emerged.

The doctor used her teeth to dig into her lip. Sweat ran down her face like rain in the Amazon. The doctor could feel a squirt dampen her panties. That squirt escaping caused the doctor’s mind to go into overdrive. She felt her brain shouting, ‘You have no idea how to take care of your body, do you?’ the doctor simply told her brain, ‘I’m doing the best I can! I…’ Her brain cut in and responded to this rebuttal with, ‘You have your chance to empty, now I’m in charge! Let us empty!’

The doctor leapt from her kneeling position. She threw her patient’s full cup of urine on the counter. Thankfully, the lid didn’t fall off.

The doctor threw open her drawer and fished inside for…

“AGGGHHHHH!!!” The doctor moaned. She stood with her pants bunched up, down at her ankles and her blue polka-dot panties hanging on a few inches above them. She remained standing as she held a cup to her pussy, her labia falling around the opening of the plastic and there was the loudest gush anyone had heard.

FLUUUUSSH went the doctor’s golden stream. The air grew heavy as she peed away all her coffee. The relief was orgasmic for sure! The doctor felt her whole body flutter while her brain pulsated. The doctor finally gave into the demands of her bladder cannon and released everything past her sphincter down into the container resting at her labia. The doctor’s body was ready to shut down, the feeling felt too grand. It was as if she had been holding a sofa above her head with her bare hands for two days and was finally able to set it down.

The patient’s eyes were like a tiger's spotting fire. The patient could not believe what he saw. It was honestly rather nerve racking for him. To see his attractive doctor piss away into one of her own patient cups at full force and out of sheer desperation.

The patient knew she needed to pee. But he hadn’t known the severity of it.

Once the doctor began to take in what she was doing, she looked apologetically to her patient and cried, “I am so, so, sooo sorry… I… I don’t know what came over me. I…”

“Hey, it’s like you said,” the patient said. “These things happen.”

The doctor grinned, feeling rather proud that her patient was using her own advice.

“Let us just enjoy this feeling,” the patient suggested.

“Good call,” the doctor assented.

Both doctor and patient smiled in blissful relief as their bladders fully drained. In the end, they filled up two cups a piece. The doctor even released an extra half a cup. The doctor pulled her undies and pants back up and put her patient’s twin cups of urine into the freezer in her office. (Which doubled as Mike and Jane’s mini fridge that they brought in their bedroom for this game).

“I feel sooo much better,” the patient moaned, an appeased smile spreading across his face.

“Me too,” the doctor said.

“Doctor, I had a question.”

“Yes?”

“Is it normally to feel horny after a good pee?”

This question was like a firework. It blew the doctor away as well as attracted extra attention to her patient.

“Umm… Yes, that is normal,” the doctor explained. “Releasing the built up tension of a full bladder is equivalent to an orgasm, some researchers believe.”

The patient nodded.

“Why?” pushed his doctor. “Are you horny right now?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Know what?”

“Humph?”

“I am too.”

The patient’s lips curled and his teeth showed.

“This may be unprofessional,” the doctor said. “But to tell you the truth, I am aroused by the sight of men passing urine to begin with. And after that tremendous piss… Well…”

Mike and Jane lay on the bed that they had used as an exam table. The exam table paper they had bought was all bunched up and ripped. It also had a small patch of cum on it (courtesy of Jane).

The two panted and sweat.

“Thanks for a great exam, Doctor,” Mike said.

“You were a good patient,” Jane replied, kissing her man. “Is it just me, or do these games get better and better?”

“Now, I suppose we have to dump those, don’t we?” Mike pointed his elbow to the mini fridge which was the current house for four and a half cups of pee between the two of them.

Jane smirked. “I have a better idea.”

Mike and Jane - still naked - knelt down in the shower. They took turns pouring their urine - which Jane had marked - over one another.

Mike moaned as Jane emptied her quarter liter of pee all over his head and watched it rush down his face, soaking his hair, and dribbling in little rivers down to his chest. Mike then dumped one of his cups over Jane, smiling as she closed her eyes tightly in anticipation. The urine flooded down Jane’s long ponytail and drenched her back. It covered her boobs, running in small streams around her nipples. Jane felt her nipples turn to stone as her partner’s liquid waste touched them.

Mike and Jane were slow - prolonging the moment - as they washed their urine away onto each other’s body.

Here is the next installment of this role-playing series! Enjoy! 🙂

The hero tugged on her chains, but they held in place like flies stuck to honey. The hero wiggled herself around. Partly in the hopes of undoing the chains, but mostly to make herself more comfortable. She feared she would be stuck here for a rather long time.

The door to her cell opened and the villain stepped in. He was dressed all in black. His cape flowing behind him, his mask pressed to his nose bridge, his grin sinister. The hero knew firsthand how maniacal her foe was.

“What do you want with me Dr. Monstruction?” The hero demanded.

Dr. Monstruction folded his hand behind his back and gave a look that told the hero she had asked the perfect question. “I am awfully sick of you foiling my plans Ms. Light,” the evil villian warned. “So now, I shall get my revenge and take care of you once and for all! Do you see the cameras?” The mad doctor motioned behind him to a large camera shining on Ms. Light like moonlight on a dark night.

“So what?” Demanded the brave hero.

“Once I turn on this camera, you shall be broadcasted to the entire world!” Laughed the foe.

“That is your plan?” The hero scrunched up her eyebrows. “You broadcast me to the world and that will only allow the police to find you must sooner. You don’t think they can track a live feed like that?”

“Oh, they will,” the villain replied. “I am certain the police will find us. But not before you piss yourself. You see, Ms. Light, my plan is simple. I force you to piss yourself all over live television. You are embarrassed and the whole city laughs at you. Your reputation will be ruined!”

“That is ludicrous!” Scoffed the hero. “I am a hero. I shall not…”

“Precisely!” Introjected Dr. Monstruction. “How oh, so silly would it look for the brave, strong hero of this city to piss herself like a child? You will be a laughingstock by this time tomorrow. I can hear them now. ‘How can Ms. Light protect the city if she cannot hold back her own bladder?’” Dr. Monstruction did his famously evil laugh.

Ms. Light truly hated to admit it - nor would she to her arch enemy - but she knew he had a point. Even if people did still trust her to protect them, even if they didn’t laugh at her, she would be so embarrassed she might be forced to flee the city. Regardless, Ms. Light still had nothing to fear. She could hold her bladder longer than anyone she knew. Plus, she didn’t have much to drink that morning. And she meant what she said. Sooner or later the police would track them down. They both knew it. She just had to hold until then.

“Well, unfortunately for you, I do not even need a piss,” Ms. Light retorted. This part was false. Ms. Light could feel the presence of her bladder, but it was still quite easy to ignore.

“No?”

“I can be like this all day,” warned the hero, perhaps a little overconfident.

“Humph. We shall see about this,” Dr. Monstruction smiled with sinister joy.

Jane had to work extra hard to wipe her smile off her face. She was enjoying this roleplaying session so much; it was hard to look miserable like her character was intended to be right now.

Jane sat on the floor; her hands held up with fake chains attached to the walls. These were the same chains Jane and her husband used for the king/servant roleplaying game.

“Remember to let me know if you are feeling uncomfortable at any time,” Mike said as he uncapped a water bottle.

For a split second, Jane was unable to recognize her husband speaking towards her real self, Jane. He had forgotten to use the safe word: Yoga.

“I will,” Jane grinned. She eagerly rattled her chains. “Now, let’s do this!” Jane smiled at the camera set up before her by Mike/Dr. Monstruction. “Make me piss myself on live TV!”

Mike snickered, setting towards his chained-up wife. “On it.”

“That’s right, drink it up,” Dr. Monstruction held Ms. Light’s head back, forcing a third whole water bottle down her gullet.

Ms. Light trembled as the last of the water rolled from the plastic down her esophagus.

“Feeling anything?” Asked Dr. Monstruction with a grin.

“No,” Ms. Light folded her below her on the floor.

Dr. Monstruction, taking note of this, smiled even more. “You will,” he promised.

“Is that all you scum?” Demanded the hero. “Give me your worst!” Ms. Light always did have a problem with overconfidence as well as talking too much.

“Oh, but I am just getting started,” chuckled the evil doctor. “Time to pull out the big guns…” He opened his torture chamber (Mike and Jane’s desk drawer) and pulled out… “One bottle of beer, coming up.”

Ms. Light swallowed. She knew beer went right through her. But she refused to show weakness.

Dr. Monstruction once again tilted the heroine’s head back and forced the alcohol down her throat. Ms. Light - having no other choice - swallowed and gulped it down appropriately. She could already feel that beer making its way through her kidneys. In mere moments, she would have to piss as bad as a small dog in the rain. Once the last of the beer was gone, the doctor stood, shook the empty bottle, and said, “And now… We wait.”

“Need to piss yet?” The villain asked. He knew the answer just from looking at his prisoner. But he was curious as to what she had to say.

Ms. Light sat before her enemy, up against the wall. Her legs were closed together and they trembled like her skin was filled with vibrators. Ms. Light’s skin began to drip with sweat and her face was beat red.

“Does someone need to piss?” Asked Dr. Monstruction with joy bouncing off his tone.

“N… No…”

“You sure? Cause you are looking awfully fidgety.”

Ms. Light’s hands pulled and tugged on the chains. She no longer cared about freeing herself. She just needed to grab her crotch so she could hopefully hold on a little longer. But no such luck. Her wrists were bound to the walls. But that did not stop the hero from keeping her legs in a tight pretzel.

“I am fine,” Ms. Light growled.

“Fine. But I say you look ready to explode. And you know what that means, don’t you, Ms. Light? Time to prepare for the main event.” With that, Dr. Monstruction flicked a switch on his camera and the machine rolled to life, filming the whole thing.

The good news was, now that the camera was on, the police would soon find Dr. Monstruction and have him arrested. The bad news was, now that she had alcohol in her bladder, Ms. Light was unsure if she could hold until the police arrived. But she would certainly have to try.

“Citizens of Lightvile,” Dr. Monstruction told the camera. “I have taken your hero, Ms. Light hostage.” Dr. Monstruction moved out of the frame, so Ms. Light’s struggling features were on screen. Ms. Light did not want her citizens to see her fidgeting. They were probably gasping and panicking enough as it was, just knowing Dr. Monstruction had her in custody. But Ms. Light also knew that should she uncross her legs or even remain still, it may result in a defeat for the great hero of the city. “And the best part is,” the villain went on. “I have her bladder held hostage as well!” He clapped his hands together and laughed with all his might.

“That is right, citizens. You are mere moments away from watching Ms. Light piss herself! Stay tuned. I am sure none of you want to miss that performance!”

Ms. Light squirmed and wiggled, her chains cutting into her circulation like snake bites. She kept her legs as tight as two contestants in a game of Twister. Her bladder boiled inside her pelvis. That water hadn’t been too bad. A bit of extra pee pressure, but she could handle that. But having drunk beer on top of it was far too much. Her kidneys had been busy. They flowed what felt like galloons down the ureters and now it all bubbled inside Ms. Light’s pee sack, begging to explode out.

Ms. Light shut her eyes, telling herself, ‘I am a hero! I can hold my urine until help arrives! I protect this city every day and every night. I can last a few hours until help comes. I must! I cannot piss myself on TV. I refuse! My piss will just have to get comfortable where it is for now. I must hold on.”

Dr. Monstruction’s plan was truly diabolical. The way to crack anyone regardless of strength… Was through public humiliation. Ms. Light could just imagine the headlines. ‘Ms. Light pees herself!’ ‘Our hero wets her pants on live TV.’ ‘Ms. Light’s bladder bites!’ ‘Ms. Light loses the fight with her bladder.’ There would be news reports, magazines, newspapers… No, she had to hold. She just had to.

Dr. Monstruction was not going to make it easy on her though. She expected as much from her arch foe. The evil doctor turned to Ms. Light. “Glass of water?” He asked in a false respectful tone. He held an empty glass and a very full picture. Just looked at the clear water sloshing around was enough to make Ms. Light’s bladder spasm.

“N… No thanks…” Ms. Light tried to keep her voice straight. She did not wish to give her captor the satisfaction of knowing the true level of her discomfort. Nor did she desire her citizens to understand the severity of her situation.

“Oh, but I insist!” Cried the doctor. “I am your host. I do not wish to be rude.” As if the matter was settled, Dr. Monstruction tiled the jug, lifting the glass, and…

Ms. Light flinched, quickly shutting her eyes, trying to block out the sound. Water flowed from the picture at the strength of an elephant’s urine stream. Ms. Light had to stop thinking of pee! She winced, feeling her bladder shift around inside her gut.

“Thirsty?” Asked Dr. Monstruction, offering the captive hero the full glass.

“N… No… Thank you…”

“Suit yourself,” and the villain sucked down the glass before her very eyes.

Ms. Light could hear the sound of her foe’s slurping as a giant sitting down on her bladder. The pain was getting to be unbearable. Ms. Light could no longer even attempt to focus on other things. The pressure inside was too great. She could feel her pussy tingle inside her tights, wishing to expel its contents right then and there. But she still held back her muscles, her sphincter refusing to let even one drop get past.

Dr. Monstruction, done with his glass, slammed it down beside him. The pang was enough to make Ms. Light’s bladder’s bladder leapt as quickly as a cat up a tree. Ms.l Light could feel that bladder of hers banging against her internal organs like a hammer smashing eggs. Every inch of her throbbed in pain and misery.

“You are looking quite uncomfortable,” Dr. Monstruction noted. He sat down beside the chained hero.

“Let me go, you scum!” Perhaps if the citizens heard how badly Ms, Light was fighting, they would still have some respect for her regardless of the outcome. It was worth a try. “I will escape one way or another,” Ms. Light warned. “And when I do, I will wring your neck like a… Oh, oh!” She yelped. Dr. Monstruction - the truly evil genius he was - pressed his hands down onto his captive’s bladder. He pushed his hands so far into Ms. Light’s rocky stomach that they disappeared like a rat into a bag of Jell-O.

“My, my, my, Ms. Light,” the villain cooed. “Your bladder is must stronger than I expected. But even elephants have their limits, you know. And your bladder is - if I may say so - very firm to the touch. Does it hurt, I wonder?”

“You may not say so, and I shall not tell you anything!” Ms. Light bellowed.

“Have it your way,” Dr. Monstruction extended his hands downwards and.

“W… What are you… Oh!” Ms. Light’s voice vanished like she suddenly swallowed a fly.

Dr. Monstruction knelt before her, and using each hand, he had separated her legs, untwisting them bit by bit like a puzzle he was taking apart, and now he kept them each held to the ground, separating them for good.

Ms. Light could feel a dribble appear on her lips. Come on, police, where are you? The hero desperately thought to herself.

“Just look how swollen your bladder is,” Dr. Monstruction smacked his lips and shook his head. “Thing’s as big as my head!”

“Given there is nothing inside, that is not large,” Ms. Light fired back.

Dr. Monstruction flinched. He was used to Ms. Light’s witty comebacks, but he had not been expecting one given her… Current situation. “Mock all you want, my hero,” Dr. Monstruction massaged her bladder with ease. “But you are still being held as my captive. So is your bladder.”

Even the light pressure was enough to make Ms. Light believe that marbles were raining down on her distended stomach. She tried to snap her legs back together, but Dr. Monstruction had planted each of his own legs over hers. Trying to close Ms. Light’s legs was as useful as closing elevator doors when someone’s arm was sticking out of the side.

“You gotta piss yet?” Demanded the villain, clearly growing impatient.

“No…”

“Don’t lie to me, hero. I invented lying! I can tell how bad you have to piss. Your bladder is as full as an aquarium! I’ll bet it even has its own sea life. Just piss out the gold. You will feel better when you do. Go on, piss for me. Piss for the camera. We are all excited to watch. You cannot keep this up forever.”

This was perhaps the most difficult test yet. Just hearing Dr. Monstruction discuss the hero’s needs was enough to make her bladder’s sphincter twist into a knot to avoid any leaks. Ms. Light hated to admit it, but Dr. Monstruction was right on the money. Her bladder was so large, it resembled a hollow basketball filled with water. It had to have held back a decent amount. At least that of a small aquarium. Ms. Light could truly not hold back much longer. And it did not appear that help would arrive anytime soon.

Dr. Monstruction kept the hero’s legs apart and continued pressing down on her fat stomach. Ms. Light’s rock-hard bladder sloshed around like a garbage bag filled with chunky milk. She had to piss now! She could feel a leak dampen her underwear.

“Go on,” Dr. Monstruction ran his hands over the slight wet spot. It was only the size of a thumb tack, but it was easy to see in Ms. Light’s bright white uniform.

“Go on, piss for us,” Dr. Monstruction challenged. “We are all watching. Let it all floooow…”

Ms. Light really wished he hadn’t said that. Hearing her enemy extend that final word, was enough to send a larger squirt into her panties. The wet patch of her white leggings expanded into the size of a baseball. Another squirt caused it to grow into a tennis ball. At this point the urine began to run in rivers down each tight. Ms. Light’s underwear was soaked and her tights were getting there as well. She could feel a swamp pressing over her pubes. Yet, the inside of her bladder was still as warm as coco. Another squirt. And another. Still her bladder and sphincter fought side by side to hold back the flood. But this was a fight that not even the hero of Lightvile could win.

“You already released so much,” Dr. Monstruction moved aside so the camera could capture the hero’s failure to contain her waters. “Let the rest out,” the villain stocked the hero’s wet vulva through her soaked tights. It was enough to make Ms. Light ready to cum. But more importantly, it made her want to pee. Feeling the grinding of wet clothes against wet pussy was unbearable. The next thing Ms. Light knew she had officially lost control.

The hero sat there, chained to the wall of her foe’s lair as a puddle, the size of a yoga mat, was created under her butt. Her white tights became as gray as silverware. A monsoon spewed from Ms. Light’s enraged labia. And despite the dread of pissing herself on camera for the entire city to see, it felt good. Ms. Light was unable to moan quite loudly as she laid her back against the wall and gave into her bodily needs. She did not hold back, she just peed, knowing full well she would feel better with every drop she drained.

Ms. Light soon sat there in a puddle of her own humiliation, but the relief was too grand. The hero felt herself orgasm from the pleasure of no longer feeling any sort of pressure in her stomach.

“You poor, poor, piss-soaked hero,” Dr. Monstruction chuckled. “Someone had an accident, didn’t she?”

“You suck, Doctor,” Ms. Light panted.

“You suck?” Dr. Monstruction looked as confused as if Ms. Light just told him to sneeze cookie dough in Chinese. “That is a rather weak comeback, hero. Does the relief feel so good you can hardly think?”

“Yes,” moaned Ms. Light.

“Well,” Dr. Monstruction climbed over her and began to pull down her soaked tights like a bathing suit. “Seeing as how I am going to jail anyway… I wish to make love to you. You may be my arch rival, but even I cannot deny your attractive qualities.”

Any other day, Ms. Light would have kicked him square in the lungs for saying such things. But today…

Still chained to the wall, Ms. Light shrugged. “I suppose I must do something with all of this orgasmic energy.”

And Dr. Monstruction mounted her and she moaned. Ms. Light knew she would have some explaining to do to the press. Not only did she piss herself on live TV, but now she was having sex with her mortal enemy on live TV! But Dr. Monstruction had a point. If you are going to get into trouble for something anyway, mind as well take it to the extreme.

And so, hero and villain had sex as if no one could see.

Mike and Jane lay against their bedroom wall. Jane was still chained to the wall, her drenched tights around her ankles, exposing her bare pussy. Mike lay on his wife’s half naked body and both of them panted.

“Never realized you made such a good super villain,” Jane giggled.

“You’re one to talk, my hero,” Mike said, enticing Jane to giggle even more.

“Want me to free you now?” Mike asked, examining his wife’s chains.

“Nah,” Jane shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t mind being your prisoner for a little longer! PS, that beer really did go right through me. I kinda need to tinkle again.”

The two kissed.
