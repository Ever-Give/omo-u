Pee Holding Tournament

I wrote yet another story. This one is about a national tournament where the competitors hold their urine.

Also, everything is exaggerated in this story. Everything from the massive bladder bulges to the length of urination to the time held… All fictional! Please never try anything this crazy!

Hope you enjoy! 🙂

Alexandria trudged through the large oak doors. The room was about the size of a large classroom. There was a camera set up on a tripod. There were also several desks piled high with cases upon cases of water bottles. There was a large television set mounted on the wall and there were a free dozen chairs arranged in horizontal lines around the room. For the most part, this room mostly contained nothing but empty space.

“Take it in, Alex,” Alexandria’s father placed an arm on his daughter’s shoulder. Alexandria’s father often referred to her as ‘Alex’. She hated when he called her that. She especially hated it when he called her that when attempting to cheer her up and make her less angry at him. It only ended up making her more frustrated with her father. “The pee holding tournament!” Alexandria’s father exclaimed. “I remember when I competed back in ‘97. I won second place.”

“I took home the gold,” Alexandria’s mother put in. She eyed her husband. “But second place, not bad.”

“This year it is all women competing,” Alexandria’s father mentioned. “So, you can relate to them better. In terms of anatomy and stuff.”

Alexandria grunted. “Guys, do I really have to do this? This is so dumb!”

“Come on, it’s fun!” Alexanderia’s father cried.

“Oh, I loved it dear,” her mother put in. “So much fun! I would still compete if it wasn’t for that pelvic surgery weakening my bladder.”

“Plus, our family has been participating in these games ever since they originated!” Her father exclaimed. “All the way back to you great-grandpapa Glen. It’s tradition!”

Alexandria folded her arms across her chest. “Well, I am twenty-three years old now. So, no offense, but I don’t have to listen to you guys.”

“First off, yes, you do. Youalways should listen to your folks!” Alexandria’s father retorted. “And second off, that is why you should start partaking in these games. The rules state you must be eighteen years old or above to enter. And third of all,” the large statured man sighed. “We shall never make you do anything you are uncomfortable with. But we think you would enjoy it if you tried it. Plus, as I said, it is tradition. It would suck to let all of that precious tradition go down the drain, wouldn’t it?”

Alexandria huffed. “Fine, I’ll give it a shot.” She hated when her family brought up their weird family traditions.

“Good girl,” her father said. Each parent took a turn kissing their adult daughter on the forehead. “We know you’ll do great,” her father said. “And remember, it is not win or lose. It is…”

“Have fun,” Alexandria sighed. “Yeah, I know.” Alexandria’s parents brought her up knowing about good sportsmanship. And now, Alexandria - while competitive at times - was a good sport, above all else!

“We’ll get you sighed up,” Alexandria’s mother told her. “And we’ll come right back and sit in those very seats cheering for you.”

Alexandria rolled her eyes. “This won’t be like my spelling bee, will it?” She asked nervously.

“No, no, of course not,” her father promised. “We learned our lesson!”

“Good,” Alexandria mumbled. Alexandria loved her parents dearly, but sometimes, they got carried away.

Two women entered the room. Elena trailed after her mother.

“Now, Elena,” her mother addressed her twenty-five-year-old daughter. “I expect you to win this tournament.”

“Yes, mother,” Elena said.

“You are the seven-year champion and I expect by day’s end, you to be the eight-year champion,” her mother went on. “These girl’s bladders have nothing against yours! Do I make myself clear?”

“Yes, mother,” Elena repeated.

“Very well, see you after the competition,” the slim woman turned to leave.

“You’re not staying?” Elena sounded hurt.

Her mother turned to face her. “You are a grown woman now. You do not need mommy to stay here and encourage you to hold your bladder. I expect you to do that on your own. Understood?”

Elena looked like she wanted to protest. Instead, she just shoved her hands in her pockets, dropped her gaze, and muttered, “Yes, mother.”

Elena watched as her mother left.

Alexandria, having witnessed the entire scene, slowly approached. “Hey?”

“Oh, hey?” Elena looked.

“That was rough,” Alexandria cut to the chase.

“Oh, that?” Elena asked. “Oh, my mother is very competitive about this sport. She is determined that I win. She has trained me and trained me, and she has made it clear that I need to win. The woman is psychotic, I swear! The moment I turned eighteen and was of legal age for this contest, she entered me to compete. And she has made me compete every year since.”

“That’s rough,” Alexandria repeated.

“She used to be a star in these games and now she wants me to follow in her footsteps,” Elena went on. “Like, I am twenty-five years old!”

“I know, right,” Alexandria snorted. “It’s like, I thought after I became an adult I wouldn’t have to worry about my parents making me do stupid things anymore. I would finally be in charge of my own life!”

“Exactly!” Elena cried, eager to have someone to agree with her. “We are grown women! If we don’t want to do this silly thing, you shouldn’t have to! I take it your parents are making you compete?”

“Kind of,” Alexandria replied. “I mean, not like your mom! My parents gave me a choice. But they were very instant that I did this. They kept saying it was tradition, it will be fun, you are above age now, they used to be big bladder stars, blah, blah, blah.”

“That is all I’ve been hearing from my mom,” Elena grumbled. “Except for the fun thing. My mom doesn’t want me to have fun. She wants me to just crush my compilation.”

“That sucks, man,” Alexandria said. “My parents always insist on coming to these things. They sit in the front row and make a ruckus the entire time.”

“At least you know they are proud of you,” Elena pointed out.

“You don’t know that about your mom?” Alexandria wondered. Elena didn’t reply. Instead, she just kept her head down. So instead, Alexandria just said, “Parents.”

“Parents,” Elena agreed.

The two women sighed.

“So, I heard your mom say you won for the past seven years?” Alexandria started a conversation.

“Yeah, I have! Even without her training my bladder is super strong,” Elena explained. “But now… Now I am like a camel! I usually pee only twice daily, even when drinking massive amounts of water. “

“Oh, wow! Looks like I have some real competition!” Alexandria laughed.

Elena wondered, “Do you know how many other people are competing this year?”

“No, but my dad said this year they are all women.”

Elena nodded. “This contest usually seems to lean more towards female competitors.”

“Does it?”

“Yeah. I mean, most years there is a man or two competing. One year, it was even a majority of male competitors. But generally speaking it is mostly women, yeah.”

“I feel like this contest should be like basketball where it is all women and all men for different tournaments. Know what I mean?”

“I do,” Elena agreed. “I agree. I mean, men generally have larger bladders than us. That might be why a lot of guys aren’t interested in competing. Women like it because it is more of a challenge whereas it is easier for men. But back to your point… I agree. Men should compete in one tournament and women in another. That would make more logical sense, I agree. But I personally like competing with a mixed group.”

“Oh, do you?”

“Yeah, like, it is more interesting to compete in a mixed group of males and females,” Elena said. “But anyway…”

The two women fell silent as their conversation trailed, and coincidentally, this is when they spotted a couple of women enter the room.

The two women were very giggly. They kept nudging each other and saying, “You’re going down!” “No, you’re going down!” “You’re the one going down!”

“It will be interesting to see what happens,” Alexandria spoke up.

The two women looked up, their smiles fading as they managed to recompose themselves.

“Sorry, we were just goofing around. Didn’t see you guys there,” a tall African American woman apologized.

“Yeah, we were caught up in our own friendly squabble,” a woman with blonde hair stretching down to her calves said.

“No worries,” Alexandria said.

“All good,” Elena agreed.

“Oh, my name is Juliet,” the long haired woman said. “And this is my BFF, Tasha.”

All four women waved and spoke at once, like crows on the side of the road.

“Hi, nice to meet you.”

“You too.”

“Nice to meet you too.”

“Hello!”

“Oh, my name is Elena,” Elena said. She turned to Alexandria, “I just realized, I never introduced myself to you either.”

“All good,” Alexandria said. “Anyway, my name is Alexandria.”

“Alexandria,” Juliet pursed her lips. “That’s kinda long. Any nicknames you got?”

“Not that I like,” Alexandria admitted.

“You’re one to talk about names!” Tasha laughed at Juliet. “You are literally named after ‘Romeo and Juliet’!”

“Oh, are you?” Elena asked, interested.

“Yeah, my dad is a big fan of Shakespear,” Juliet replied.

The conversation between the four women was cut short when a muscular man with dashing blue eyes approached. “How are we all doing today, ladies?” He asked.

Once again, the four women spoke over one another.

“Good. You?”

“Not bad, not bad.”

“Hanging in there.”

“Fine, you?”

“Excellent, excellent,” the man said. “My name is Leonard and I’m in charge of this event. This year we have six competitors, so we are just waiting on two more. In the meantime, I ask you all to visit the restrooms, get your bladders nice and drained and we will be starting soon.”

The woman thanked him and he walked off.

“Oh, hey,” Juliet called. “Where is the ladies’ room?” But alas, Leonard was out of earshot.

“I’ll show you girls,” Elena said. “I am a regular, I participate every year.”

“Oh?” Tasha asked.

Juliet bobbed her head. “Okay.”

And so, Elena led the way from the room and towards the bathrooms.

Melody entered the tournament room. Melody was accompanied by her husband, Logan.

“Well, babe, this is it! The pee holding tournament!” Melody took a full circle turn, taking it all in. “Long time since I’ve been here.”

“Babe, are you sure you are up for this?” Logan asked. “I mean, after three kids…”

“I’m fine,” Melody insisted. “I may have given birth to three kids, but I still have the bladder of an elephant!” Logan looked ready to argue. Melody cut him off and said, “You just worry about finding a good seat to watch me whip the other competitor’s butts!”

Logan felt his underwear get heavy. “I like a woman who can hold in her pee,” Logan said, feeling like a dunce.

“Yeah,” Melody giggled, placing her hands on her husband’s chest and kissing him on the lips.

“But sweety, still,” Logan forced himself to return to reality. “I love you, and please don’t take this the wrong way, but… Isn’t holding your pee like… A young woman’s game?”

Melody recoiled, a smile still on her face. “What are you saying?” She asked playfully. “My bladder is too old and worn down for this?”

“Well, after three kids and living for forty-one years… It might be, yeah,” Logan said.

Melody raised an eyebrow. Still speaking in a playful voice, she said, “Am i going to have to prove my bladder’s strength to you, mister?”

“No, I know you have a strong bladder, babe!” Logan promised. “But you are…”

“I am what? Old?”

“Yes. But also a mother.”

“I’ll be fine. I told you, just find a good seat and quit worrying.” With that, Melody spun her husband around, gave him a good slap on the bottom, and let to use the restroom one final time.

Melody, of course, didn’t admit that she knew Logan was right. Melody hasn’t competed in these games in over a decade! She was forty-one years old with three kids. Melody had a feeling that she would be the first one out. But she also knew that there was no shame in losing. Logan was just proud of her for competing. And so were her kids. And so was she.

Alexandria, Elena, Juliet, and Tasha sat behind four out of five ladies’ room stalls. The sounds of urine rippling against the toilet water were heard only over the sound of stall-to-stall chatter.

“I hope I can win again this year,” Elena said. “It will be my eighth year in a row. My mom really wants me to win.”

“I see,” Tasha said, over her particularly noisy stream.

“Tasha, Juliet,” Alexandria said from the end stall. “If I recall correctly, you girls said you were having a friendly squabble? What…”

“Oh, well, you see, we both have pretty big bladders,” Juliet explained. “And so, about a month ago, we got into a friendly, yet serious debate over who’s bladder was larger.”

“So, we decided to sign up for the tournament and see,” Tasha explained.

“So, did you guys actually make some sort of bet?” Elena asked, over her hissy pee.

“No, it’s more just like a friendly competition than anything else,” Tasha explained.

“Well, no need to worry ladies,” Elena replied. “Neither one of you will win after all. Because I will be the one to win!”

“Oh yeah?” Juliet demanded.

“We’ll see about that!” Tasha cried.

“I’m not so sure, Elena,” Alexandria warned. “So, Tasha, Juliet, this is you guys' first year competing?” Alexandria stood up and picked up her underwear off her knees.

Juliet leaned forward on the bowl so she could wipe. “Yeah, first year.”

“Mine too,” Alexandria’s voice was drowned out by her toilet flushing.

“Nice,” Tasha rebuckled her belt.

Melody entered the bathroom and took the remaining stall, just as Alexandria exitted hers. Tasha and Juliet came out a moment later. One by one, the women finished their business and started on their way back to the room.

Upon returning to the tournament room, the women found several men and women had taken their seats, eager to watch the tournament. Among the crowd was Alexandria’s parents and Melody’s husband. Elena did her very best to hide her disappointment that her mother hadn’t shown up. Many of the spectators held buckets of popcorn or had sodas with them. It was just like going to the movies for many people.

“Okay, folks,” Leonard addressed the crowd. “We are just waiting on one more. They should…”

“I’m here, I’m here!” A sixth competitor ran into the room. “Sorry, I’m late. Things are crazy at work and I had to do a couple hours before getting here… Mind if I pee real quick.”

Leonard smirked. “For a contest like this, I recommend that you do. But be quick. We are nearly ready to start.”

“Yes, of course,” the woman zipped down the hall.

“While we are waiting,” Leonard said. “Let me start off by saying, thank you all for coming to the seventy-fifth annual pee holding tournament!” The crowd applauded. “This event will be broadcasted all over the whole country,” Leonard went on. The camera man waved with one hand and kept the other firmly grasped on the handle of his massive camera. “Now, the rules for this tournament are simple,” Leonard went on. “Our competitors here will drink as much liquid as they can without hurting themselves. We have lots of water over here. 

But this isn’t just any water. No, it is heavy water. This water is thrice as heavy as regular water. You drink this and you will add three times the amount of water to your system. We also have heavy coffee, heavy tea, heavy ginger ale, heavy soda, and heavy beer for anyone that is interested. With that said, the competitors must drink as much as they can and make themselves have to use the restroom. The competitors must hold their urine longer than the others in order to win this game. Leaking is allowed. You may leak or trickle or even squirt some urine here and there.

However, if the stream comes out and refuses to stop, you are out. You may quit and use the restroom at any time, should you not want to wet yourselves. But be warned, if you do use the bathroom, you have officially lost. The competitors are not allowed to leave this room for any reason, unless of course they are going to the bathroom. As far as the judge - myself - is concerned, you have lost the moment you leave this room. Also, you have been disqualified should you stop drinking for ten minutes or more. Do not force yourself to drink to the point you feel unwell, but you must do your hardest to keep drinking liquid, and liquid of your choosing.

We want to get you ladies desperate after all! However, when you get to the point of total desperation - in other words, you can no longer sit still - then you are free to stop drinking. And if at any point any of you feel unwell, please just go and use the restroom. This is supposed to be a fun game and a nice tournament! It is not worth your health. Seriously, I cannot stress that strongly enough… Do not harm yourself. You all must be eighteen to enter, and I believe you are. You all are also required to have submitted in a container containing your maximum amount of urine ever done in one sitting over the past year. Which you all have done, as well.

With that all out of the way, let us meet our competitors! First up, we have Alexandria. Alexandria’s family is famous for not only participating in these games, but doing rather well in them.” Alexandria’s parents cheered and hollered in their seats. Alexandria turned beat red. This was worse than the spelling bee! This was a very rather small room. At least the spelling bee was an auditorium. But if Alexandria’s parents screamed in here - which they did - not only was the noise extra loud, but everyone was easily able to tell who they were and why they were cheering.

Leonard waited for the couple to calm down before continuing. “Alexandria is twenty-three years old and lives in Burlington. She is a lawyer at a law firm and her record urination was one liter.” The crowd applauded politely. Except for Alexandria’s parents, who once again screamed and hollered.

“Next,” Leonard went on. “We have Elena who is our reigning champion of the past seven years. Just like her daughter, Elena’s mother was the champion of every tournament she ever entered.” Leonard smiled at Elena. “I see big bladdered genes run in the family! Elena is twenty-five years old and is currently working as a waitress working towards her doctorate degree. She is studying to become a veterinarian of horses. She lives in Shelburne and her record pee is a whopping two and a half liters!” The crowd cheered on that one. Elena bowed. The other competitors began to look a bit nervous upon hearing this. Two and a half liters… That was a lot for the bladder to hold at once!

“Next, we have Tasha,” Leonard said. “Tasha is a first timer. She has entered this tournament along with her best friend, Juliet in an attempt to settle once and for all who has the largest bladder.” Giggles and chuckles filled the crowd. Tasha and Juliet just smiled and waved. “Tasha is thirty-three years old and lives in St. Johnsbury. She is a fashion designer for films and TV shows, and her record breaking pee is that of one point four liters.” The crowd applauded, but nothing like they did for Elena.

“Next up, Juliet,” Leonard went on. “Juliet…” At this moment, the final competitor slowly slipped into the room. She gave an apologetic wave to Lenoard. Leonard just nodded and the woman took her spot on the other side of Melody. “Juliet, like Tasha, entered this tournament as a way to settle who has the largest bladder captivity among the two. I am anxious to know myself!” That got some laughs from the spectators and the competitors alike. “Juliet is twenty-eight years old and lives in St. Johnsbury as well. She is a computer scientist and her maximum urination is that of one point seven liters.” This earned some light cheering.

“Next, we have Melody,” Leonard stated. “Melody used to partake in this tournament every year. But she has not for eleven years. Until today, that is. Melody was raised on a farm and now lives in Burlington with her husband Logan and their three children. Melody is now forty-one years old and has a job as an accountant and as proof that even between middle age and childbirth her bladder is still on top, Melody’s personal urination record is a liter and a half.” More cheers.

Melody had no idea why everyone kept bringing up her age. Then again, she is well aware that mostly younger men and women compete in these games. Melody is a lot older than any of her competition after all! Melody had just been joking with Logan before. But now… She honestly felt like she had to win these games to show everyone, as Lenoard put it, her bladder is still on top.

“And our sixth and final competitor is Carmen,” Leonard said. “Carmen is twenty-six years old and currently lives in Charlotte. Carmen has competed in this tournament for the past three years, but sadly has never won. That may change today, however. Carmen works as a businesswoman at a very busy company. No wonder she was late!” Some chuckles. Poor Carmet breathed an exhale, as if to show everyone how overworked she was. “Carmen’s personal record of urine over the past year, is one point nine liters. Wow! She may give Elena a run for her money.” The crowd laughed.

Carmen looked slightly confused. With a grin, Elena pointed her fingers to her eyes and then pointed them at Carmen's and back again. Elena did this to A) playfully intimidate her competition. And B) to help Carmen (having arrived late) know who she was.

“On that topic,” Leonard addressed Carmen. “Carmen, you have been here before. You know the drill. Heavy drinks, and if you feel unwell, please use the bathroom. But if you leave the room, you forfeit.”

Carmen nodded her understanding.

“Very well,” Leonard turned to face the crowd. “Let the games begin!"

*001*2023-01-31 18:27

The crowd faced one another, chatting amongst themselves. This was the most boring part of the tournament. The contestants first had to fill up their bladders. But with the heavy drinks - and the vast amount they were consuming - that should not take an absurd length of time.

All of the contestants drank down bottle after bottle of heavy water. Just for a chance of pace, most of the contestants switched back and forth between heavy water, heavy beer, and heavy soda. That is except for Alexandria who stuck to heavy water, claiming that it made her need to pee more than anything. Melody - hating the taste of water - drank all heavy soda and even some heavy tea.

Someone had pulled out six stools for all six competitors to sit down on while waiting.

After an hour of nonstop drinking, Melody threw her right leg over her left. Her competitors took note of this and smiled.

“Feeling an urge?” Elena teased from down the row of stools.

“A little one,” Melony used her leg to sit on her hand.

“Keep holding,” Alexandria said with a smirk as she sipped some heavy water. “Got to hold on for a while.”

While the crowd talked, the contestants did as well. It helped pass the time.

Carmen apologized again for being late. She explained to the group how she deals with numbers and work is always super chaotic. She is always called in on her days off and constantly has to work overtime. This is her one day off a week, and her boss almost made her work the entire day. Her boss told her that this was a silly tournament and was not worth missing work - even though it should have been Carmen’s day off in the first place. Fortunately, Carmen was able to convince her boss to let her work only half a day and she could get the rest off.

“At least you made it,” Juliet said, taking a big gulp of heavy soda.

“Yeah, I suppose,” Carmen held her head back and began chugging some heavy beer.

Melody began running her hands up and down her skinny legs. “Bosses are tough,” Melody complained. Melody found her competition smiling at her. “What?”

“You look like your bladder is filling fast,” Alexandria commented.

Melody crossed her legs tightly, her toes pointed inwards. “Let’s just say… That damn heavy stuff has done its job!” Melody placed both feet on the floor and picked up her heavy teacup off the floor. Melody casually sipped her tea, her legs bouncing the whole time.

Juliet’s leg began bouncing as well. Juliet hasn’t even realized it at first. Then, it suddenly hit her like a brick. She had to pee as well! Just like Carmen at her job, Juliet’s poor kidneys were working overtime to filter out all of that heavy water and other heavy liquids she drank. Juliet was easily able to tell that she indeed did drink three times more than what she thought she did. While this may be Juliet’s first urge to visit the lavatory, Juliet’s bladder felt extra full. Fuller than it should, this being a first urge and all.

“Okay, folks, it has been two hours,” Leonard brought the room back. “Let us check in on our contestants. Let’s go left to right. In a few words, ladies, tell us how you are feeling. Make sure to speak nice and loudly so the camera can hear you. Also, I ask that you please be honest. This tournament is only fair and well-judged if we truly know how you are feeling.”

“Right,” Alexander faced the camera. She was very much aware of her parents staring at her intently as if she was in the middle of telling them an engaging story. “Well,” Alexandria did her hardest to ignore her parents as she said, “I got my first urge about ten minutes ago. It is kind of a strong urge to be honest,” Alexandria giggled, brushing her hair behind her ear. ‘But I’m mostly doing okay for now.”

Alexandria’s parents leapt to their feet, hands applauding widely. Alexandria held her head. Why did she have such embarrassing parents! She was in her twenties! Alexandria had hoped they would stop embarrassing her once she graduated high school. But nope. They were still as embarrassing as ever.

“Very nice, Alexandria,” Leonard said, as soon as her folks calmed down. “Elena?”

Elena faced the camera. She knew her mother wasn’t here… But she couldn’t help but wonder if she was watching. She had to be watching… Right? Seems harsh her mother is making her do this thing and won’t even watch from home!

“Hi,” Elena waved shyly. “I’m doing fine. I don’t have to go at all yet, honestly.”

The crowd gawked at this.

“Incredible!” Leonard cried. “Two hours of drinking heavy stuff and not a single drop has hit your bladder. You truly take after your mother, Elena!”

Elena didn’t know how to take that.

“Okay, Tasha?” Leonard asked.

“Have to pee, but not super bad,” Tasha started.

“How long do you think you have?” Leonard asked.

“Until I lose or until I am desperate?”

“Both?”

Tasha pursed her lips. “I’d say in about another hour at the latest I’ll be super squirm,” Tasha held her head so she could scratch her cheek with her red acrylic nails. “And I’ll probably lose in four or five.”

“Wow, four or five hours left for Tasha!” Leonard cried. “Well, Tasha, we might make you eat those words! How are you doing, Juliet? I notice both you and your neighbor are extra fidgety.”

Juliet and Melody kept squirming and wiggling in their stools. Either girl was unable to sit still.

“Honestly, Leonard,” Juliet hugged her knees to her chest. She smiled directly at the supervisor for the event, then looked ahead at the camera. “I really have to go!” Juliet said with a smirk. “No use in denying it, you all can see how squirmy I am anyway.”

“True, true… How long do you have?” Leonard asked.

“I’d say a few hours.”

Leonard’s eyes grew big. “A few hours?”

“Yeah.”

Leonard said, “Okay, like that determination! Melody? You were the first to wiggle. How’s that mom bladder of yours?”

Melody giggled, which was a mistake for her bladder. “Honestly, Leonard… My bladder is in that stage where… It is critical that I find a washroom!”

“Already?”

“Yeah… It’s true, I have three kids and am a fossil,” Melody laughed.

“Do you think you can hold it?”

“I’m gonna try!” Melody laced her legs though her arms and pulled the former up into the air. “But my kidneys made a lot of pee and now that pee is in my bladder, anxious to end its journey!”

“Well, thank you for that imagery,” Leonard said. Everyone laughed. “Try and keep holding,” Leonard encouraged.

“Oh, don’t worry. I’m keeping it all locked up. It’s not going anyway!” Melody promised. Melody bit her bottom lip and held her knees to her genitalia. “Although, it wants to real bad!”

“Okay, and lastly, Carmen?” Leonard asked. “How’re we feeling?”

“Have to tinkle,” Carmen nodded sharply. “I seriously need a piss right now, to be honest! But I can hold for quite some time.” Carmen’s toes began tapping against the quartz floor.

“Very nice, ladies,” Leonard said. “Well, we’ll let you gals get back to drinking! Let us know if you need anything! Oh, and Juliet, Melody, since you two are so squirmy, you are not required to drink anything more. You can if you wish, but if you hope to win this tournament, I would recommend that you don’t!”

And so, four of the women continued drinking down heavy fluids while the other two sat there and just potty danced.
