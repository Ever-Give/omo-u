Pee Holding Tournament

I wrote yet another story. This one is about a national tournament where the competitors hold their urine.

Also, everything is exaggerated in this story. Everything from the massive bladder bulges to the length of urination to the time held… All fictional! Please never try anything this crazy!

Hope you enjoy! 🙂

Alexandria trudged through the large oak doors. The room was about the size of a large classroom. There was a camera set up on a tripod. There were also several desks piled high with cases upon cases of water bottles. There was a large television set mounted on the wall and there were a free dozen chairs arranged in horizontal lines around the room. For the most part, this room mostly contained nothing but empty space.

“Take it in, Alex,” Alexandria’s father placed an arm on his daughter’s shoulder. Alexandria’s father often referred to her as ‘Alex’. She hated when he called her that. She especially hated it when he called her that when attempting to cheer her up and make her less angry at him. It only ended up making her more frustrated with her father. “The pee holding tournament!” Alexandria’s father exclaimed. “I remember when I competed back in ‘97. I won second place.”

“I took home the gold,” Alexandria’s mother put in. She eyed her husband. “But second place, not bad.”

“This year it is all women competing,” Alexandria’s father mentioned. “So, you can relate to them better. In terms of anatomy and stuff.”

Alexandria grunted. “Guys, do I really have to do this? This is so dumb!”

“Come on, it’s fun!” Alexanderia’s father cried.

“Oh, I loved it dear,” her mother put in. “So much fun! I would still compete if it wasn’t for that pelvic surgery weakening my bladder.”

“Plus, our family has been participating in these games ever since they originated!” Her father exclaimed. “All the way back to you great-grandpapa Glen. It’s tradition!”

Alexandria folded her arms across her chest. “Well, I am twenty-three years old now. So, no offense, but I don’t have to listen to you guys.”

“First off, yes, you do. Youalways should listen to your folks!” Alexandria’s father retorted. “And second off, that is why you should start partaking in these games. The rules state you must be eighteen years old or above to enter. And third of all,” the large statured man sighed. “We shall never make you do anything you are uncomfortable with. But we think you would enjoy it if you tried it. Plus, as I said, it is tradition. It would suck to let all of that precious tradition go down the drain, wouldn’t it?”

Alexandria huffed. “Fine, I’ll give it a shot.” She hated when her family brought up their weird family traditions.

“Good girl,” her father said. Each parent took a turn kissing their adult daughter on the forehead. “We know you’ll do great,” her father said. “And remember, it is not win or lose. It is…”

“Have fun,” Alexandria sighed. “Yeah, I know.” Alexandria’s parents brought her up knowing about good sportsmanship. And now, Alexandria - while competitive at times - was a good sport, above all else!

“We’ll get you sighed up,” Alexandria’s mother told her. “And we’ll come right back and sit in those very seats cheering for you.”

Alexandria rolled her eyes. “This won’t be like my spelling bee, will it?” She asked nervously.

“No, no, of course not,” her father promised. “We learned our lesson!”

“Good,” Alexandria mumbled. Alexandria loved her parents dearly, but sometimes, they got carried away.

Two women entered the room. Elena trailed after her mother.

“Now, Elena,” her mother addressed her twenty-five-year-old daughter. “I expect you to win this tournament.”

“Yes, mother,” Elena said.

“You are the seven-year champion and I expect by day’s end, you to be the eight-year champion,” her mother went on. “These girl’s bladders have nothing against yours! Do I make myself clear?”

“Yes, mother,” Elena repeated.

“Very well, see you after the competition,” the slim woman turned to leave.

“You’re not staying?” Elena sounded hurt.

Her mother turned to face her. “You are a grown woman now. You do not need mommy to stay here and encourage you to hold your bladder. I expect you to do that on your own. Understood?”

Elena looked like she wanted to protest. Instead, she just shoved her hands in her pockets, dropped her gaze, and muttered, “Yes, mother.”

Elena watched as her mother left.

Alexandria, having witnessed the entire scene, slowly approached. “Hey?”

“Oh, hey?” Elena looked.

“That was rough,” Alexandria cut to the chase.

“Oh, that?” Elena asked. “Oh, my mother is very competitive about this sport. She is determined that I win. She has trained me and trained me, and she has made it clear that I need to win. The woman is psychotic, I swear! The moment I turned eighteen and was of legal age for this contest, she entered me to compete. And she has made me compete every year since.”

“That’s rough,” Alexandria repeated.

“She used to be a star in these games and now she wants me to follow in her footsteps,” Elena went on. “Like, I am twenty-five years old!”

“I know, right,” Alexandria snorted. “It’s like, I thought after I became an adult I wouldn’t have to worry about my parents making me do stupid things anymore. I would finally be in charge of my own life!”

“Exactly!” Elena cried, eager to have someone to agree with her. “We are grown women! If we don’t want to do this silly thing, you shouldn’t have to! I take it your parents are making you compete?”

“Kind of,” Alexandria replied. “I mean, not like your mom! My parents gave me a choice. But they were very instant that I did this. They kept saying it was tradition, it will be fun, you are above age now, they used to be big bladder stars, blah, blah, blah.”

“That is all I’ve been hearing from my mom,” Elena grumbled. “Except for the fun thing. My mom doesn’t want me to have fun. She wants me to just crush my compilation.”

“That sucks, man,” Alexandria said. “My parents always insist on coming to these things. They sit in the front row and make a ruckus the entire time.”

“At least you know they are proud of you,” Elena pointed out.

“You don’t know that about your mom?” Alexandria wondered. Elena didn’t reply. Instead, she just kept her head down. So instead, Alexandria just said, “Parents.”

“Parents,” Elena agreed.

The two women sighed.

“So, I heard your mom say you won for the past seven years?” Alexandria started a conversation.

“Yeah, I have! Even without her training my bladder is super strong,” Elena explained. “But now… Now I am like a camel! I usually pee only twice daily, even when drinking massive amounts of water. “

“Oh, wow! Looks like I have some real competition!” Alexandria laughed.

Elena wondered, “Do you know how many other people are competing this year?”

“No, but my dad said this year they are all women.”

Elena nodded. “This contest usually seems to lean more towards female competitors.”

“Does it?”

“Yeah. I mean, most years there is a man or two competing. One year, it was even a majority of male competitors. But generally speaking it is mostly women, yeah.”

“I feel like this contest should be like basketball where it is all women and all men for different tournaments. Know what I mean?”

“I do,” Elena agreed. “I agree. I mean, men generally have larger bladders than us. That might be why a lot of guys aren’t interested in competing. Women like it because it is more of a challenge whereas it is easier for men. But back to your point… I agree. Men should compete in one tournament and women in another. That would make more logical sense, I agree. But I personally like competing with a mixed group.”

“Oh, do you?”

“Yeah, like, it is more interesting to compete in a mixed group of males and females,” Elena said. “But anyway…”

The two women fell silent as their conversation trailed, and coincidentally, this is when they spotted a couple of women enter the room.

The two women were very giggly. They kept nudging each other and saying, “You’re going down!” “No, you’re going down!” “You’re the one going down!”

“It will be interesting to see what happens,” Alexandria spoke up.

The two women looked up, their smiles fading as they managed to recompose themselves.

“Sorry, we were just goofing around. Didn’t see you guys there,” a tall African American woman apologized.

“Yeah, we were caught up in our own friendly squabble,” a woman with blonde hair stretching down to her calves said.

“No worries,” Alexandria said.

“All good,” Elena agreed.

“Oh, my name is Juliet,” the long haired woman said. “And this is my BFF, Tasha.”

All four women waved and spoke at once, like crows on the side of the road.

“Hi, nice to meet you.”

“You too.”

“Nice to meet you too.”

“Hello!”

“Oh, my name is Elena,” Elena said. She turned to Alexandria, “I just realized, I never introduced myself to you either.”

“All good,” Alexandria said. “Anyway, my name is Alexandria.”

“Alexandria,” Juliet pursed her lips. “That’s kinda long. Any nicknames you got?”

“Not that I like,” Alexandria admitted.

“You’re one to talk about names!” Tasha laughed at Juliet. “You are literally named after ‘Romeo and Juliet’!”

“Oh, are you?” Elena asked, interested.

“Yeah, my dad is a big fan of Shakespear,” Juliet replied.

The conversation between the four women was cut short when a muscular man with dashing blue eyes approached. “How are we all doing today, ladies?” He asked.

Once again, the four women spoke over one another.

“Good. You?”

“Not bad, not bad.”

“Hanging in there.”

“Fine, you?”

“Excellent, excellent,” the man said. “My name is Leonard and I’m in charge of this event. This year we have six competitors, so we are just waiting on two more. In the meantime, I ask you all to visit the restrooms, get your bladders nice and drained and we will be starting soon.”

The woman thanked him and he walked off.

“Oh, hey,” Juliet called. “Where is the ladies’ room?” But alas, Leonard was out of earshot.

“I’ll show you girls,” Elena said. “I am a regular, I participate every year.”

“Oh?” Tasha asked.

Juliet bobbed her head. “Okay.”

And so, Elena led the way from the room and towards the bathrooms.

Melody entered the tournament room. Melody was accompanied by her husband, Logan.

“Well, babe, this is it! The pee holding tournament!” Melody took a full circle turn, taking it all in. “Long time since I’ve been here.”

“Babe, are you sure you are up for this?” Logan asked. “I mean, after three kids…”

“I’m fine,” Melody insisted. “I may have given birth to three kids, but I still have the bladder of an elephant!” Logan looked ready to argue. Melody cut him off and said, “You just worry about finding a good seat to watch me whip the other competitor’s butts!”

Logan felt his underwear get heavy. “I like a woman who can hold in her pee,” Logan said, feeling like a dunce.

“Yeah,” Melody giggled, placing her hands on her husband’s chest and kissing him on the lips.

“But sweety, still,” Logan forced himself to return to reality. “I love you, and please don’t take this the wrong way, but… Isn’t holding your pee like… A young woman’s game?”

Melody recoiled, a smile still on her face. “What are you saying?” She asked playfully. “My bladder is too old and worn down for this?”

“Well, after three kids and living for forty-one years… It might be, yeah,” Logan said.

Melody raised an eyebrow. Still speaking in a playful voice, she said, “Am i going to have to prove my bladder’s strength to you, mister?”

“No, I know you have a strong bladder, babe!” Logan promised. “But you are…”

“I am what? Old?”

“Yes. But also a mother.”

“I’ll be fine. I told you, just find a good seat and quit worrying.” With that, Melody spun her husband around, gave him a good slap on the bottom, and let to use the restroom one final time.

Melody, of course, didn’t admit that she knew Logan was right. Melody hasn’t competed in these games in over a decade! She was forty-one years old with three kids. Melody had a feeling that she would be the first one out. But she also knew that there was no shame in losing. Logan was just proud of her for competing. And so were her kids. And so was she.

Alexandria, Elena, Juliet, and Tasha sat behind four out of five ladies’ room stalls. The sounds of urine rippling against the toilet water were heard only over the sound of stall-to-stall chatter.

“I hope I can win again this year,” Elena said. “It will be my eighth year in a row. My mom really wants me to win.”

“I see,” Tasha said, over her particularly noisy stream.

“Tasha, Juliet,” Alexandria said from the end stall. “If I recall correctly, you girls said you were having a friendly squabble? What…”

“Oh, well, you see, we both have pretty big bladders,” Juliet explained. “And so, about a month ago, we got into a friendly, yet serious debate over who’s bladder was larger.”

“So, we decided to sign up for the tournament and see,” Tasha explained.

“So, did you guys actually make some sort of bet?” Elena asked, over her hissy pee.

“No, it’s more just like a friendly competition than anything else,” Tasha explained.

“Well, no need to worry ladies,” Elena replied. “Neither one of you will win after all. Because I will be the one to win!”

“Oh yeah?” Juliet demanded.

“We’ll see about that!” Tasha cried.

“I’m not so sure, Elena,” Alexandria warned. “So, Tasha, Juliet, this is you guys' first year competing?” Alexandria stood up and picked up her underwear off her knees.

Juliet leaned forward on the bowl so she could wipe. “Yeah, first year.”

“Mine too,” Alexandria’s voice was drowned out by her toilet flushing.

“Nice,” Tasha rebuckled her belt.

Melody entered the bathroom and took the remaining stall, just as Alexandria exitted hers. Tasha and Juliet came out a moment later. One by one, the women finished their business and started on their way back to the room.

Upon returning to the tournament room, the women found several men and women had taken their seats, eager to watch the tournament. Among the crowd was Alexandria’s parents and Melody’s husband. Elena did her very best to hide her disappointment that her mother hadn’t shown up. Many of the spectators held buckets of popcorn or had sodas with them. It was just like going to the movies for many people.

“Okay, folks,” Leonard addressed the crowd. “We are just waiting on one more. They should…”

“I’m here, I’m here!” A sixth competitor ran into the room. “Sorry, I’m late. Things are crazy at work and I had to do a couple hours before getting here… Mind if I pee real quick.”

Leonard smirked. “For a contest like this, I recommend that you do. But be quick. We are nearly ready to start.”

“Yes, of course,” the woman zipped down the hall.

“While we are waiting,” Leonard said. “Let me start off by saying, thank you all for coming to the seventy-fifth annual pee holding tournament!” The crowd applauded. “This event will be broadcasted all over the whole country,” Leonard went on. The camera man waved with one hand and kept the other firmly grasped on the handle of his massive camera. “Now, the rules for this tournament are simple,” Leonard went on. “Our competitors here will drink as much liquid as they can without hurting themselves. We have lots of water over here. 

But this isn’t just any water. No, it is heavy water. This water is thrice as heavy as regular water. You drink this and you will add three times the amount of water to your system. We also have heavy coffee, heavy tea, heavy ginger ale, heavy soda, and heavy beer for anyone that is interested. With that said, the competitors must drink as much as they can and make themselves have to use the restroom. The competitors must hold their urine longer than the others in order to win this game. Leaking is allowed. You may leak or trickle or even squirt some urine here and there.

However, if the stream comes out and refuses to stop, you are out. You may quit and use the restroom at any time, should you not want to wet yourselves. But be warned, if you do use the bathroom, you have officially lost. The competitors are not allowed to leave this room for any reason, unless of course they are going to the bathroom. As far as the judge - myself - is concerned, you have lost the moment you leave this room. Also, you have been disqualified should you stop drinking for ten minutes or more. Do not force yourself to drink to the point you feel unwell, but you must do your hardest to keep drinking liquid, and liquid of your choosing.

We want to get you ladies desperate after all! However, when you get to the point of total desperation - in other words, you can no longer sit still - then you are free to stop drinking. And if at any point any of you feel unwell, please just go and use the restroom. This is supposed to be a fun game and a nice tournament! It is not worth your health. Seriously, I cannot stress that strongly enough… Do not harm yourself. You all must be eighteen to enter, and I believe you are. You all are also required to have submitted in a container containing your maximum amount of urine ever done in one sitting over the past year. Which you all have done, as well.

With that all out of the way, let us meet our competitors! First up, we have Alexandria. Alexandria’s family is famous for not only participating in these games, but doing rather well in them.” Alexandria’s parents cheered and hollered in their seats. Alexandria turned beat red. This was worse than the spelling bee! This was a very rather small room. At least the spelling bee was an auditorium. But if Alexandria’s parents screamed in here - which they did - not only was the noise extra loud, but everyone was easily able to tell who they were and why they were cheering.

Leonard waited for the couple to calm down before continuing. “Alexandria is twenty-three years old and lives in Burlington. She is a lawyer at a law firm and her record urination was one liter.” The crowd applauded politely. Except for Alexandria’s parents, who once again screamed and hollered.

“Next,” Leonard went on. “We have Elena who is our reigning champion of the past seven years. Just like her daughter, Elena’s mother was the champion of every tournament she ever entered.” Leonard smiled at Elena. “I see big bladdered genes run in the family! Elena is twenty-five years old and is currently working as a waitress working towards her doctorate degree. She is studying to become a veterinarian of horses. She lives in Shelburne and her record pee is a whopping two and a half liters!” The crowd cheered on that one. Elena bowed. The other competitors began to look a bit nervous upon hearing this. Two and a half liters… That was a lot for the bladder to hold at once!

“Next, we have Tasha,” Leonard said. “Tasha is a first timer. She has entered this tournament along with her best friend, Juliet in an attempt to settle once and for all who has the largest bladder.” Giggles and chuckles filled the crowd. Tasha and Juliet just smiled and waved. “Tasha is thirty-three years old and lives in St. Johnsbury. She is a fashion designer for films and TV shows, and her record breaking pee is that of one point four liters.” The crowd applauded, but nothing like they did for Elena.

“Next up, Juliet,” Leonard went on. “Juliet…” At this moment, the final competitor slowly slipped into the room. She gave an apologetic wave to Lenoard. Leonard just nodded and the woman took her spot on the other side of Melody. “Juliet, like Tasha, entered this tournament as a way to settle who has the largest bladder captivity among the two. I am anxious to know myself!” That got some laughs from the spectators and the competitors alike. “Juliet is twenty-eight years old and lives in St. Johnsbury as well. She is a computer scientist and her maximum urination is that of one point seven liters.” This earned some light cheering.

“Next, we have Melody,” Leonard stated. “Melody used to partake in this tournament every year. But she has not for eleven years. Until today, that is. Melody was raised on a farm and now lives in Burlington with her husband Logan and their three children. Melody is now forty-one years old and has a job as an accountant and as proof that even between middle age and childbirth her bladder is still on top, Melody’s personal urination record is a liter and a half.” More cheers.

Melody had no idea why everyone kept bringing up her age. Then again, she is well aware that mostly younger men and women compete in these games. Melody is a lot older than any of her competition after all! Melody had just been joking with Logan before. But now… She honestly felt like she had to win these games to show everyone, as Lenoard put it, her bladder is still on top.

“And our sixth and final competitor is Carmen,” Leonard said. “Carmen is twenty-six years old and currently lives in Charlotte. Carmen has competed in this tournament for the past three years, but sadly has never won. That may change today, however. Carmen works as a businesswoman at a very busy company. No wonder she was late!” Some chuckles. Poor Carmet breathed an exhale, as if to show everyone how overworked she was. “Carmen’s personal record of urine over the past year, is one point nine liters. Wow! She may give Elena a run for her money.” The crowd laughed.

Carmen looked slightly confused. With a grin, Elena pointed her fingers to her eyes and then pointed them at Carmen's and back again. Elena did this to A) playfully intimidate her competition. And B) to help Carmen (having arrived late) know who she was.

“On that topic,” Leonard addressed Carmen. “Carmen, you have been here before. You know the drill. Heavy drinks, and if you feel unwell, please use the bathroom. But if you leave the room, you forfeit.”

Carmen nodded her understanding.

“Very well,” Leonard turned to face the crowd. “Let the games begin!"

*001*2023-01-31 18:27

The crowd faced one another, chatting amongst themselves. This was the most boring part of the tournament. The contestants first had to fill up their bladders. But with the heavy drinks - and the vast amount they were consuming - that should not take an absurd length of time.

All of the contestants drank down bottle after bottle of heavy water. Just for a chance of pace, most of the contestants switched back and forth between heavy water, heavy beer, and heavy soda. That is except for Alexandria who stuck to heavy water, claiming that it made her need to pee more than anything. Melody - hating the taste of water - drank all heavy soda and even some heavy tea.

Someone had pulled out six stools for all six competitors to sit down on while waiting.

After an hour of nonstop drinking, Melody threw her right leg over her left. Her competitors took note of this and smiled.

“Feeling an urge?” Elena teased from down the row of stools.

“A little one,” Melony used her leg to sit on her hand.

“Keep holding,” Alexandria said with a smirk as she sipped some heavy water. “Got to hold on for a while.”

While the crowd talked, the contestants did as well. It helped pass the time.

Carmen apologized again for being late. She explained to the group how she deals with numbers and work is always super chaotic. She is always called in on her days off and constantly has to work overtime. This is her one day off a week, and her boss almost made her work the entire day. Her boss told her that this was a silly tournament and was not worth missing work - even though it should have been Carmen’s day off in the first place. Fortunately, Carmen was able to convince her boss to let her work only half a day and she could get the rest off.

“At least you made it,” Juliet said, taking a big gulp of heavy soda.

“Yeah, I suppose,” Carmen held her head back and began chugging some heavy beer.

Melody began running her hands up and down her skinny legs. “Bosses are tough,” Melody complained. Melody found her competition smiling at her. “What?”

“You look like your bladder is filling fast,” Alexandria commented.

Melody crossed her legs tightly, her toes pointed inwards. “Let’s just say… That damn heavy stuff has done its job!” Melody placed both feet on the floor and picked up her heavy teacup off the floor. Melody casually sipped her tea, her legs bouncing the whole time.

Juliet’s leg began bouncing as well. Juliet hasn’t even realized it at first. Then, it suddenly hit her like a brick. She had to pee as well! Just like Carmen at her job, Juliet’s poor kidneys were working overtime to filter out all of that heavy water and other heavy liquids she drank. Juliet was easily able to tell that she indeed did drink three times more than what she thought she did. While this may be Juliet’s first urge to visit the lavatory, Juliet’s bladder felt extra full. Fuller than it should, this being a first urge and all.

“Okay, folks, it has been two hours,” Leonard brought the room back. “Let us check in on our contestants. Let’s go left to right. In a few words, ladies, tell us how you are feeling. Make sure to speak nice and loudly so the camera can hear you. Also, I ask that you please be honest. This tournament is only fair and well-judged if we truly know how you are feeling.”

“Right,” Alexander faced the camera. She was very much aware of her parents staring at her intently as if she was in the middle of telling them an engaging story. “Well,” Alexandria did her hardest to ignore her parents as she said, “I got my first urge about ten minutes ago. It is kind of a strong urge to be honest,” Alexandria giggled, brushing her hair behind her ear. ‘But I’m mostly doing okay for now.”

Alexandria’s parents leapt to their feet, hands applauding widely. Alexandria held her head. Why did she have such embarrassing parents! She was in her twenties! Alexandria had hoped they would stop embarrassing her once she graduated high school. But nope. They were still as embarrassing as ever.

“Very nice, Alexandria,” Leonard said, as soon as her folks calmed down. “Elena?”

Elena faced the camera. She knew her mother wasn’t here… But she couldn’t help but wonder if she was watching. She had to be watching… Right? Seems harsh her mother is making her do this thing and won’t even watch from home!

“Hi,” Elena waved shyly. “I’m doing fine. I don’t have to go at all yet, honestly.”

The crowd gawked at this.

“Incredible!” Leonard cried. “Two hours of drinking heavy stuff and not a single drop has hit your bladder. You truly take after your mother, Elena!”

Elena didn’t know how to take that.

“Okay, Tasha?” Leonard asked.

“Have to pee, but not super bad,” Tasha started.

“How long do you think you have?” Leonard asked.

“Until I lose or until I am desperate?”

“Both?”

Tasha pursed her lips. “I’d say in about another hour at the latest I’ll be super squirm,” Tasha held her head so she could scratch her cheek with her red acrylic nails. “And I’ll probably lose in four or five.”

“Wow, four or five hours left for Tasha!” Leonard cried. “Well, Tasha, we might make you eat those words! How are you doing, Juliet? I notice both you and your neighbor are extra fidgety.”

Juliet and Melody kept squirming and wiggling in their stools. Either girl was unable to sit still.

“Honestly, Leonard,” Juliet hugged her knees to her chest. She smiled directly at the supervisor for the event, then looked ahead at the camera. “I really have to go!” Juliet said with a smirk. “No use in denying it, you all can see how squirmy I am anyway.”

“True, true… How long do you have?” Leonard asked.

“I’d say a few hours.”

Leonard’s eyes grew big. “A few hours?”

“Yeah.”

Leonard said, “Okay, like that determination! Melody? You were the first to wiggle. How’s that mom bladder of yours?”

Melody giggled, which was a mistake for her bladder. “Honestly, Leonard… My bladder is in that stage where… It is critical that I find a washroom!”

“Already?”

“Yeah… It’s true, I have three kids and am a fossil,” Melody laughed.

“Do you think you can hold it?”

“I’m gonna try!” Melody laced her legs though her arms and pulled the former up into the air. “But my kidneys made a lot of pee and now that pee is in my bladder, anxious to end its journey!”

“Well, thank you for that imagery,” Leonard said. Everyone laughed. “Try and keep holding,” Leonard encouraged.

“Oh, don’t worry. I’m keeping it all locked up. It’s not going anyway!” Melody promised. Melody bit her bottom lip and held her knees to her genitalia. “Although, it wants to real bad!”

“Okay, and lastly, Carmen?” Leonard asked. “How’re we feeling?”

“Have to tinkle,” Carmen nodded sharply. “I seriously need a piss right now, to be honest! But I can hold for quite some time.” Carmen’s toes began tapping against the quartz floor.

“Very nice, ladies,” Leonard said. “Well, we’ll let you gals get back to drinking! Let us know if you need anything! Oh, and Juliet, Melody, since you two are so squirmy, you are not required to drink anything more. You can if you wish, but if you hope to win this tournament, I would recommend that you don’t!”

And so, four of the women continued drinking down heavy fluids while the other two sat there and just potty danced.

*003*2023-03-24 01:18

Yeah, this thread didn't seem to have too much interest so I kind of abandoned it lol. I'll post more soon!

*004*2023-03-25 18:21

Hour three came to an end and all four women slowly became more and more desperate for a bathroom.

Melody was now standing. She held her crotch and shuffled from foot to foot. She wrapped her legs and unwrapped them. She crossed her legs and uncrossed them. Melody’s situation was now dire as her bladder neared full capacity. Perhaps everyone was right. Perhaps middle age and motherhood had taken too much of a toll on her bladder.

But Melony took comfort in the fact that she was not the only contestant who was bursting full of hot urine. Juliet was also quite desperate herself. Regardless, all six ladies had bladders that were filling rapidly. All six contestants now had an urge to pee, and most were experiencing difficulty with sitting still.

“Okay,” Leonard said. “It has been five hours now. How are our ladies holding up? I see quite a bit of squirming going on over here.” It was true, all six ladies had their legs crossed and a few were reaching for their genitals. “Alexandria,” Leonard said. “We shall once again start with you. How are you feeling?”

“Honestly…” Alexandria kept her legs tightly crossed. “Kinda full, Leonard.”

“Kinda full,” Leonard nodded, a smile across his pale face. “Can you hold it?”

“I’m gonna try,” Alexandria said in response.

“That’s all you can do,” Leonard said.

Alexandria gigged. “All you can do,” she agreed.

Alexandria’s parents once again stood. They began shouting words of encouragement to their grown daughter.

“You can do it, honey!” Her mom cried.

“Keep it in, sweetie!” Shouted her father.

Meanwhile, Alexandria wanted to melt into a puddle of shame.

“How about you, Elena?” Leonard inquired. “You doing okay?”

“Yeah, I’m fine,” Elena’s toe was tapping. “Gotta pee. Nothing urgent though.”

“Wow! You have a strong bladder!” Leonard exclaimed. Elena laughed. “Tasha, how we holding up?” Leonard moved along.

“Fine,” Tasha had her legs crossed and her hands buried in between them. “Have a lot of pee inside my bladder.”

“Ah, yes, well, do your best to keep it there,” Leonard joked. Tasha gave him a thumbs-up. “Juliet? How are you doing?” Leonard asked. “You holding back the flood?”

Juliet was wiggling wildly on her stool. Her butt moved up and down and to the side. Her knuckles were turning white. Sweat poured down her face. Her legs were tripled-crossed below her. “Honestly… I am struggling, Leonard,” Juliet admitted.

Leonard smiled. “Oh, yeah?”

“Yep. It wants to come out!” Juliet wailed.

Leonard smirked. “But you won’t let it out… Will you?”

“I’m trying… Trying real hard…” Juliet moaned.

“Well, keep holding Juliet. Don’t want to lose to your friend sitting next to you,” Leonard warned. Tasha smirked at Juliet. Juliet gave her the middle finger.

“Speaking of desperation, how are you doing Melody?” Leonard asked.

“Full to bursting!” Melody wailed. Melody was still standing. She kept one hand in her crotch and continuously bounced up and down on each foot. She was chewing the nails of her free hand. Sweat dripped down her face. Her eyes resembled that of someone struggling with a heavy box. And in this case, Melody’s heavy box was her urinary bladder.

“You are quite full, huh?’ Leonard asked.

Melody gave a weak nod, mumbling under her breath about how she desperately needed a restroom.

“Don’t hurt yourself, remember,” Leonard instructed. “If you must leave to use the restroom, do so. But of course, know that if you do, you forfeit as well.”

“N… No, I… I am fine…” Melody hobbled around, knees bent together, face twisted in sheer agony. “I can… I… I can hold it…”

“If you say so,” Leonard turned to the final contestant. “Carmen, how are you feeling down there?”

“Uncomfortable,” Carmen admitted. She adjusted the waistband of her pants. Carmen sat far back on her stool, her legs kept crossing and uncrossing. “I wouldn’t say I am urgent yet, but this is certainly the point I would seriously start searching for a washroom.”

“I see,” Leonard replied. “Well, keep holding it in Carmen!” Leonard turned to the crowd and addressed them, “Aren’t these contestants wonderful! We have given them beverages that are three times as powerful as normal liquids, and it has been five hours, and they are still holding! I am highly impressed! Seeing as how you are all very squirmy, you may all stop the liquids now. That is except for Elena. Elena may be squirming slightly, but nothing compared to the rest of you. Elena, keep drinking. The rest of you may stop the beverages and hold yourselves as you, please. Good luck, ladies. We shall check in again in an hour and see who is still holding.”

The hour ticked by. For all six contestants, the hour seemed slow. It appeared slow to some due to the discomfort of a full bladder. While others felt the hour move so slowly on account of being rather bored, waiting for their bladder to swell to maximum size.

Hour six was slowly approaching and all of the contestants had yet to let out so much as a dribble. Leonard was right. The contestants all had very large bladders, hence why they entered this tournament, to begin with. Of course, large bladders were only half of it. These contestants all also went through training.

To pass the time, the contestants decided to chat amongst themselves about that very training.

“My mom made me drink gallons of water every day and only let me use the bathroom once,” Elena explained.

“Oh, god!” Tasha cried. “That is a bit far if you ask me.”

Elena glugged down some heavy water. “Yeah, well…” Elena wiped her upper lip with the back of her hand. “Mom is serious about this competition.”

“I trained by drinking three gallons of liquid a day,” Melody explained. “And I was only allowed to have a bathroom break after I finished a gallon.”

“Wow,” Alexandria cried. “For a middle-aged bladder that had given birth, that is impressive!”

“Hey, I may be middle-aged with kids,” Melody shot back. “But trust me, girl, my bladder still has some give!”

“We’ll just see about that,” Alexandria smirked. “My parents helped me train. They made me drink a gallon and hold for as long as I could.”

“So, you didn’t actually have a set schedule?” Tasha asked.

“Nope. I just held until I could hold no longer,” Alexandria replied.

“I wish I had that,” Elena crossed her legs. “Every now and then, I slipped and had an accident. Mom was furious!”

“Your mom sounds nice,” Carmen joked.

“My husband helped me train,” Melody squatted up and down. “He’s in the audience actually,” Melody pointed to her husband who waved at the contestants.

“My parents are also here,” Alexandria grumbled.

“We know,” Tasha said.

“China knows your parents are here!” Carmen joked. “Anyway, I trained by drowning six gallons in a go and peeing twice daily.”

“Whoa!” Melody exclaimed. “That is a lot of liquid!”

“You may give me a run for my money after all,” Elena giggled, sipping her water.

“Juliet and I trained the same way,” Tasha mentioned. “We both drank a liter a piece and held it for two hours, at first. Then, as we got more comfortable with holding, we increased our water consumption as well as the time between bathroom breaks.”

“That’s the way to do it,” Alexandria muttered.

“Yeah, but thinking about it isn’t helping right now,” Juliet moaned, holding herself tightly.

“Oh, poor Juliet, you need to pee pee?” Alexandria teased.

“Mum-hum…” Juliet moaned.

“Keep holding, girls,” Alexandria smiled. “Or don’t. If you guys pee, we win, so…”

“Well, I won’t let you,” Melody said. “I’ll just keep on holding!”

“Ha!” Elena cackled. “You look ready to pop, Melody!”

Melody just groaned, shuffling her feet, and rearing her head down in pain.

After so much liquid to drink, all six contestants were busy fidgeting and squirming. Alexandria was squeezing her crotch and crossing her legs tightly. Elena - the least fidgety of them all - was just tapping her toes and occasionally resting her hand on her lap. Tasha, meanwhile, had her legs crossed, one hand in her crotch, the other on the side of her stoll, and was rocking back and forth on her hand. Juliet had migrated to sitting on the floor. Juliet had her legs triple crossed and had tears in her eyes from all the holding. Juliet’s whole body trembled as she clung onto her genitalia as if her life depended on it. Melody still stood. She double-crossed her legs and bounced up and down. Her hands were constantly tapping against her thighs. Carmen was busy holding her legs in the shape of a pretzel and squeezing herself. Carmen was sweating nearly as much as Juliet and Melody. These ladies were all clearly in dire need of the restroom!

“I’m just happy the drinks are over,” Carmen turned her legs into a pretzel. “Sorry, Elena.”

Still slurping water, Elena merely rolled her eyes and aimed her middle finger at Carmen.

The worst part was that these women were forced to watch the audience get up and leave to use the restroom, while they all had to keep holding it inside.

“Oh, my sphincter is growing so weak,” Melody complained, hunching down to run her hands up and down her tired legs.

“Then pee, no one is stopping you,” Alexandria smiled.

“I am stopping me! I will last!” Melody wailed.

“Nah, girl, you look ready to burst!” Tasha cried. “You and this one,” she jabbed a finger at Juliet. “Julie, Leonard is right. You lose and that means I have a stronger bladder! Looks like I have nearly won our little dispute!”

“Not yet, I can hold a bit more…” Juliet panted.

“No, Juliet, I’d say you have nearly lost,” Elena called. “Come on, Juliet, Melody… Just think about your bladders. You know, it’s not good to hold. Just let it out and let it flood. Your bladders as well as your bodies will feel sooo much better!”

“Yeah,” Alexandria lifted her butt up and down off of her seat. “You two just go pee. It will feel so good!”

“So refreshing!” Carmen agreed.

“Not helping, girls,” Juliet moaned, rolling around on her backside.

“Last time I checked,” Alexandria said. “We are your competition! We are not supposed to be helping you girls!”

“Come on, let it out, let it flow…” Carmen teased. “Come on, everyone else is using the bathroom! How about you two use the bathroom as well?” Carmen

@@folded her arms into her pretzel legs. “Come on, girls. Go pee.”

“I’ll bet you two want a toilet,” Alexandria said.

“I… I want a toilet…” Juliet moaned.

“We know you do,” Alexandria nodded in response.

“Go on and go to the toilet,” Elena encouraged. “Sit down, take a nice loooooong tinkle into the bowl!”

“I… I want to tinkle…” Juliet moaned.

“Yeah, Julie, go take a tinkle!” Melody wailed. “Trickle! You’ll feel better afterwards!” Melody hopped up and down on one foot. She kept the other foot only inches from the ground as she pressed her knees into one another and rapidly chewed her fingernails.

“You too, Melody,” Alexandria added.

“Yeah, you go piss too!” Tasha cried.

“Me?” Melody’s voice came out squeaky. “Nah. I can hold. I… I can hold… Oh, god!” Melody reared down, squeezing herself.

“What’s wrong, Melody?” Elena asked.

“Yeh gonna pee?” Carmen taunted.

“Uh-oh!” Leonard called, rushing over. “Looks like we have some teasing going on over here! You girls trying to psych each other out?” The contestants all stammered in agreement of this statement. “Well, it is that time again… Bladder check! How we feeling, Alexandria?” Leonard asked.

“Full,” Alexandria admitted. “Have to pee… Bad! But I can last!”

“Very good, Elena?”

“Have to pee. Nothing too severe yet.”

“Strong bladder, I see!” Leonard smirked. “Tasha?”

“Very full. But I can hold on.”

“I see… Juliet?”

Juliet was busy rocking back and forth, holding her knees close to her chest, moaning, and wincing from the pain. “I… I have to…”

“Have to what?’ Leonard mocked. “Pee?”

“Yeah…” Juliet gave a weak nod.

“My, my, my,” Leonard said. ‘I must say, Juliet, you look awfully desperate over there. Can you last?”

“I… I don’t think so,” Juliet admitted. “I… I am trying, Leonard… But… That… that stuff went right through me!”

“Ah, yes. Three times the liquid intake has a tendency to do that,” Leonard joked. “Try to keep holding, Juliet. But if you must go, go. Please do not harm yourself.” Juliet gave a shaky bob of the head. “How about you, Melody? I believe Juliet took your spot as the most desperate.”

“Yeah,” Melody looked down at the shaking, sobbing, rocking mess that was Juliet. “I do think she needs to go worse than me… But I am still very desperate!”

“Are you?” Leonard gave a goofy smile, suggesting that he had no idea, but he was excited to hear this news. “How long can you hold out?”

“Not much longer, I don’t think,” Melody admitted.

“Well, keep it in,” Leonard replied. “If things go the way they are, you may up as the second to lose control, followed by Juliet.” Laughing, Leonard continued on, “Carmen, my girl! How we feeling?”

“Need to potty,” Carmen whined, squeezing her thighs. “Joking aside, I really need the restroom!”

“You look like it!” Leonard laughed. “The heavy water effect you too, did it?”

“That it did,” Carmen giggled.

Leonard asked, “How much longer do you think you have before you… yeh know…” Leonard waved his hands below his crotch to suggest a wetting accident.

“Umm…” Carmen pursed her lips. “Soon, I think. I know I can last longer than these two,” she motioned to the two competitors to her left. “But I really have to use the bathroom! I don’t know how much longer my bladder can take it…”

“Well, good luck,” Leonard said. “And you shall need it! Because now we arrive at the first challenge. Just to make things interesting,” Leonard pointed at a man who held an iPad. The man tapped his screen and instantly, the TV behind the women turned on. And on the TV was the image of a downpour of rainwater. All six full bladders instantly lunged as they were forced to listen to the blaring sounds of water.

*005*2023-03-28 01:31

Melody’s full bladder instantly gave a squirt. Melody bit her lip and cursed silently. Melody felt her panties fill up with hot urine and that urine seeped through to her sweatpants. The very sound of water was simply too much for her tired aching, middle-aged, mom bladder. The good news was, it was just a quick squirt. Melody was able to stop it immediately. The bad news was that the hiss from her squirt was extra loud and now the crotch of her sweat was dark gray. Melody was positive that someone would notice. The last thing Melody needed was for them to torment her more. If melody received any more torture, she may just burst open! Melody's fears became a reality when Leonard turned to face her.

“My, my, Melody… Is that a leak, I see?”

Melody’s hands shot to her crotch. Both to help hold and to help cover the evidence. “No…” Melody’s voice peeped.

“Really?” Leonard asked. “Cause I heard a hiss and saw some darkness from you.”

Curse this man’s excellent hearing and vision!

“You leaked?” Alexandria cried.

All eyes were on Melody.

“Okay, okay,” Melody moaned. “I leaked, I leaked. You happy! I leaked!” The crowd began to whisper and mutter to one another. The crowd was quite literally on the edge of their seats, anxious to see what would become of Melody’s overfilled bladder. Melody spotted Logan in the crowd. Melody feared disappointing him. But Logan didn’t appear upset. He just smiled and waved.

“You said leaking doesn't count though, right?” Elena wondered of Leonard.

“It doesn’t,” Leonard agreed. He grinned at Melody. “But full-on accidents do! And it looks to me like we are getting closer and closer to having one of those on our hands!”

“Look, look,” Melody stumbled around like a drunk. “What happened… What happened was…”

“Yeah…” Tasha said, tauntingly.

“See, my bladder was just so filled up, and more urine is coming down from my kidneys, see… My kidneys have yet to process all of that heavy stuff!” Melody fumbled for an excuse to explain her leak. “And see, my bladder was just so full… That when more urine came down, it was like, ‘hey, we don’t have anywhere to put this…’ And it squirted some out to make room.” The crowd, contestants, and Leonard all mumbled in mocking tones, clearly not believing her. “That’s all it was, that’s all it was!” Melody held up both hands and waved them to the crowd in a ‘hold on one second’ gesture. Melody kept her knees together and stumbled back and forth on the floor while waving. “Just an attempt to make some room!” Melody explained. “My bladder just needed room so some pee had to come out!”

“Sure, sure, Melody, we believe you,” Leonard joked.

“Of course, that is all it was!” Tasha cried.

“Obviously,” Carmen snorted.

Melody smiled at Logan and he smiled back. Melody knew she was acting like a goof. But she also knew that was one of the things Logan liked best about her. Melody knew she didn’t have to win to impress him. But she would still do her very hardest to hold everything back! But as the pressure on her mom bladder grew, Melody could tell another squirt was on its way.

“Turn it up, Chat,” Leonard instructed the man with the iPad.

Silence fell as the roaring sounds of rain drowned everyone out.

Millions of heavy raindrops filled the black background of the screen. They all came thundering down onto the asphalt, each one making an individual pruussh sound that when combined was as loud as the roar of a herd of elephants.

The image changed and now resembled that of a creek. Gentle flowing water swam down the sides. Water crashed against rocks, splashing over the sides in an attempt to keep on moving forward. The sounds of trickling water were heard all throughout the room.

The image changed again to show a raging waterfall. A waterfall - that must have been one hundred feet in height - was shown on the screen, causing a very loud roaring sound as it collided with the water below it. The lake below rippled as the water was pulled in all directions, splashing down from its one-hundred-foot-long fall off the cliff.

The image changed to that of waves in the ocean. Enormous tides grew upwards until they finally crashed down on the surface of the expansive cerulean ocean. White sea foam rippled across the waves and the seawater, shooting outwards all over the surface of the grand waters.

The image became one of a fire hydrant exploding. The red fire hydrant burst into bits, allowing a ten-foot-tall geyser of water to spring from the ground and climb higher and higher into the sky, the sound defining to all passing by. The water geyser broke apart and squirts of cold water flew back toward the ground in their own separate streams. And yet, more water just kept erupting from the ground, causing the geyser to never end.

The image switched to that of a men’s bathroom. A man stood at a large urinal bowl, filled to the brim with sloshing clear water. While the man - nor his genitals - were on screen, the women saw clearly a light yellow stream come from somewhere off the frame, and make its way, arcing through the air and crashing down into the water. The water rippled and an all too familiar tinkling sound was heard.

Each image was even more painful than the last. But upon watching an actual urine stream, Juliet’s bladder gave in. Her sphincter weakened, only for a second, and allowed a massive leak to escape. This leak was nearly twice as big as the one Melody had done. Juliet’s jeans instantly became dark. Juliet leaped to her feet, cursing widely. She grasped and grabbed herself. The first stream had stopped, but another came out. Juliet’s entire vulva was now soaking. As were her underwear and jeans.

Juliet squeezed tight, tighter, tighter than she ever had before. But it was no use. Her muscles were simply too weak and strained from this long hold and the massive amount of liquids they were attempting to hold back. Another hot squirt erupted into the jeans of Juliet. She managed to close it off, but she felt her pee hole already begin to twitch open to allow yet another leak out.

Juliet stood, urine seeping down her pant leg, causing the stain to grow and grow. Juliet felt warm pee gush down her thigh which was hindering her ability to hold farther.

“Uh oh,” Leonard poked fun at. “Looks like Juliet has sprung a leak! And a pretty big leak too!”

“What’s the matter, Juliet?” Tasha squirmed. “Unable to hold like a big girl?”

The SH sound formed on Juliet’s lips. She may have been about to shout at Taasha to shut up, or about to swear. Either way, she was too fatigued to get the words out. All of Juliet’s concentration went into not expelling any more fluids. However, she had drunk far too much. She had over five liters. And given the fact that this fluid was three times heavier than its original counterpart, Juliet had drunk about four gallons of fluid. It wanted out. It needed to come out!

“How, Juliet,” Leonard exclaimed. “Check out that bulge!”

Juliet’s stomach was protruding several inches from her chest. It was so large, Juliet nearly fell down just trying to carry the damn thing! A large squirt shot out. Cursing and biting her teeth, Juliet silenced the stream.

Meanwhile, Melody felt a little trickle escape her shut pee hole. It was nearly nothing like Juliet was doing, however. Exhilaration washed over Melody as she began to realize that she may not be the first one to burst her bladder!

“Oh… OH NO!!!” Juliet wailed. Tears were streaming down her face in two separate streams, one from each eyeball. Puddles of sweat were forming on Juliet’s forehead and arms. Her hands were trembling and her legs were wobbling, unable to support the weight of her bladder. Juliet’s urethra kept involuntarily contracting open and closed, open and closed. Each time it opened a jet of warm liquid shot from it. And now, it opened. Juliet’s sphincter gave in to the heaps of pressure from her bladder.

Juliet now stood there, pee gushing from her, her jeans growing darker and shinier by the second, sweat and tears over her face, her pee hole twitching, her bladder slowly shrinking, and the scent of pee growing in the air.

Juliet peed her pants entirely. And it felt good. A large puddle slowly began to form at the feet of the fallen competitor.

The crowd cheered as did Juliet’s competition.

Juliet peed and peed. Juliet just held her head back and moaned. Several long moments passed as Juliet’s bladder drained itself entirely. Juliet now stood, soaking wet and smelling of pee… But empty. And it felt good!

Juliet’s perception levels decreased as did her tears. And so did her bladder bulge vanish from sight.

Melody had to take a step back to avoid standing in Juliet’s overwhelmingly large pee puddle. Tasha also had to move her stool to the side. Carmen lifted her feet onto her stool as Juliet’s massive puddle began to flow downstream, so to speak.

“Well, one down, five to go!” Leonard wailed. “How do you feel, Juliet?”

“Wet and sticky… But I am relieved!” Juliet exhaled! The crowd laughed and so did Leonard.

“Looks like my bladder is indeed stronger!” Tasha mocked.

Juliet just stuck her tongue out at her best friend. Juliet truly hated the idea of Tasha winning their little contest. She mostly hated Tasha now knowing that she did in fact have a larger bladder than Juliet. Juliet was mostly upset about coming in last place. Juliet now knew she had the smallest bladder here! Out of her competition, anyway. But truthfully… Juliet was just grateful for the relief! And this may be the freedom of her bladder talking, but she had fun. Juliet really didn’t care that she lost. She enjoyed herself regardless!

“How about you go get cleaned up, Juliet?” Leonard asked. “We have some spare pants for you.” One of Leonard's assistants came forward with a pair of jeans, t-shirt, underwear, and socks. This was good because Juliet quite literally soaked everything!

“Good call,” Juliet took the supplies from the assistant and walked to the door. “Watch out for that,” she motioned to her puddle. “And Tasha… You will lose! And I will laugh and laugh!”

“Maybe so,” Tasha hugged her knees. “But at least I won’t be the first one out! Now that is just embarrassing!”

Rolling her eyes, Juliet left the room, dripping wet, leaving a long trail of pee in her wake.
