How about frigg and freya seductively asking thor to not let them pee when they are at a dinner at odin's palace.

That's a good idea! As mentioned before in this thread, I have written a ton of Greek mythology stories. I'm probably going to post them before adding this one. Unless I decide to mix things up and go back and forth between mythologies. I might do that actually if you think it's a good idea. Post a few Greek stories and then Norse and Egyptian and so on. That way it's more diverse!

Would you be open to goddesses intentionally holding their pee and getting turned on by people watching them?

I sort of did this concept with Iris the rainbow goddess. Iris loves omorashi and has fun with a full bladder. Her husband, Zepheryus even gets in on the fun and fools around with Iris and her swollen bladder. I'll post this story next!

This next story is about Iris the messenger goddess and goddess of the rainbow. Enjoy! 🙂

PS, this story contains female masturbation and ejaculation. So, here's your warning!!!!

Iris soared through the skies, her golden wings flapping like a dove’s as she went into a nosedive toward the earth. Iris chewed her lip and adjusted her mail sack. She shoved a hand down deep into her rainbow-patterned skirt and held it with all of her godly strength. Poor Iris was at the point where she had to fly with her legs held as tight together as the snakes of Hermes’ staff. And yet, Iris was loving every second of this.

The rainbow goddess just adored sailing through the air, feeling the breeze in her wings and along her back, and feeling her heavy, bulging bladder weigh her down. In all of her immortal years, Iris has never told anyone her secret. But the rainbow goddess was deeply into, what the mortals called, omorashi. There was no better feeling to Iris than the fullness of a rock-hard bladder. Iris could feel her godly bladder shove down on her sphincter with all its might. The feeling was enough to make Iris’ irises roll back in her head.

Iris used her rainbow staff - the one that controlled light - and stuffed it in between her legs like a wizard riding a broomstick. Iris held her staff there, unintentionally making an arch of color in the sky behind her.

Iris bunched up her multicolored skirt, enjoying the feeling of almost wetting. One of the problems with being a goddess, it takes a long time to fill up. Even longer to become desperate. And while that is normally a blessing, for one into omorashi, it is a curse. Iris had to wait over eleven days now for her bladder to get this full. The wait was the most annoying thing ever! But knowing what lies beyond the rainbow, so to speak, Iris would happily wait weeks to become desperate every time.

And so, Iris continued her daily messages for Hera. Iris spotted her target. Hating to have to hide her desperation - but also wanting to be professional - Iris squeezed her muscles as tight as they would go, removed her staff from under her skirt, and shot down towards the mortal world.

Iris sat in a mortal chair, slyly shifting her weight around. She crossed and uncrossed her legs, hoping her mortal host wouldn’t notice her discomfort.

Inachus looked over the scroll Iris had delivered to him. Iris waited as patiently as possible in her small chair as the King of Argos’ eyes had their fill of the words given to him by the rainbow goddess. At long last, Inachus muttered, “Unbelievable…”

Iris feared the king would have this reaction. But at the present moment, Iris also feared not staying dry! The rainbow goddess squirmed and squirmed, and said, “Everything okay, my lord,” knowing very well it was not. It felt strange calling a mortal ‘lord’, but Iris wanted to be respectful.

“Hera has informed me that that blasted sea god, Poseidon is not budging,” King Inachus snarled. “That dumb god dried up all of my land’s water, you know.” Iris nodded. As the messenger of Hera, she already knew this story. But again, for the sake of being polite, she pretended she hadn’t a clue what was going on. “All because my kingdom decided to make Hera our patron god over Poseidon,” Inachus grunted.

“Poseidon is a sore loser,” Iris mentioned. “Just ask Athena.” Iris shifted a laugh which only put added pressure on her submerged pelvis.

“Well,” Inachus’ attention turned back to his scroll. “Hera has tried to convince Poseidon to give us our water back. We need that water. It allows us to fish and travel around Greece. That water is important! And now, all the springs, lakes, rivers, even the sea, all gone! Nothing but soil!”

Iris swallowed hard, the only thing she could do to keep herself from moaning. Iris’ legs were crossed in a double knot, her feet hanging over one another, and her whole body twisted more times than the Gordian Knot. Oh, why oh, why did Iris’ task have to deal with water of all things! The Fates either hated Iris or liked her and wanted to make her desperation more severe. Normally Iris would have loved that, but she didn’t want to lose her godly ocean right in the center of King Inachus’ throne room.

“Hera says Poseidon isn’t budging and refuses to give us back our water,” the king complained, eyes down on parchment. Each time King Inachus used the W-word, Iris felt a squirt push against her sealed sphincter. “Now Hera says, if we want our water back, we must promise to build Poseidon, a temple where the tide ebbs the shore.” Inachus angrily rolled up the scroll. “This land was supposed to be dedicated to Hera, not Poseidon,” the king said in fury, shaking his scroll around. “Poseidon is such a…”

Iris cleared her throat loudly, likely saving the king more headaches down the line. “Careful what you say about the divine,” Iris advised, looking to the high ceiling.

Inachus blushed. “Right,” he coughed into his fist and said, “Iris, please tell Hera that - against my own free will - I accept to Posiedon’s terms.”

“Excellent,” eager to leave, Iris leaped to her sandals. The rainbow goddess quickly realized her mistake when her body rocked with desperation. Iris nearly fell back down. She was well aware of her bladder bulging from her toga. Iris briefly debated asking the king to use the restroom of his palace. Only the rich had restrooms in their home, and King Inachus was certainly rich! Iris was a guest in his home, after all. It was only proper etiquette. But Iris knew with her godly bladder, she would fill up the entire toilet before even being a quarter empty. She refused to do that to the kind king. She just hoped he didn’t notice her dilemma. Just in case, the rainbow goddess held her staff in front of her. She knew it was far too skinny to hide her bulge, but it was better than nothing.

Iris could not help but jiggle her legs behind her. She held one foot to her crotch and bowed to King Inachus as best she could. The king bowed back.

“Thank you for everything, my lady of the rainbow,” Inachus said.

“You are quite welcome,” Iris replied. “Good luck with your… Water situation…” Iris knee her face cringed on the second to last word, but Inachus thankfully didn’t appear to notice.

“Thank you,” he said, returning to his throne. “I cannot wait to get my kingdom’s water back.”

As she left, Iris muttered to herself, “You wish to get your water back, I wish to get my water out!” That line alone caused Iris’ clitoris to swell to the size of a pomegranate.

Iris returned to Olympus and gave Hera the news. Iris kept her legs laced the entire conversation and continuously twirled her staff to distract herself.

“Excellent,” Hera said. “I shall inform Posiedon right now. I am so happy to put this whole water business behind us.”

Iris cringed again. Ironically, she was beginning to feel the exact same way. “Well,” the rainbow goddess turned. “If that is all, then I will just…”

“Hold on,” Hera stood from her throne.

Iris froze. “That is what I am trying to do,” she grunted to herself.

“I have one last task for you for the day,” Hera said.

“But Hera… My lady… I thought that was my final task!” Hera had already told Iris this was her final task for the day. Iris had been overjoyed! She already had her desperate masturbation session planned in her head. She seriously didn’t want to have to do anything else!

“Zeus requests you deliver a message to Tartarus,” Hera informed.

Tartarus? On a full bladder? Iris panicked. “Get Hermes to do it,” Iris snapped, ruder than she intended.

“Hermes has his own tasks,” Hera replied. “And anyway, Zeus figured you would be the best person to do this.”

Iris grunted, irritated. She was so ready to return to her bedroom and finger herself until she burst. But it looked like she would have to wait a little longer.

“Fine,” grunted the rainbow goddess. “Who is the message for?”

Hera then said something Iris least expected. “Arke, you know… Your twin sister.”

Iris wished she could say she would have protested more. But no one argues with Hera. And even if Iris was feeling argumentative, those feelings would have vanished upon hearing who the recipient of this message was.

And so, the rainbow goddess locked her legs together and flapped her wings as fast as they would go. Iris shot straight down into the city-state of Attika and right into the mouth of the cave in the Parnes Mountains. Iris instantly heard the babbling and wailing of the River Acheron, the River of Pain. There came the unmistakable sounds of the dead begging Iris to jump into the river with them and share their misery. But after having traveled to the underworld countless times before, Iris has gotten pretty good at tuning them out. But this time, in particular, it was easy to tune them out. Iris’ bladder was screaming so loudly, she hardly heard a word the river said. She did, however, hear the currents gently gurgling along their path.

Iris stitched her legs even tighter. Despite her bad situation, Iris quite loved this moment. The fullness of her bladder was pressing down extra hard onto her vulva. At that moment, Iris’ clitoris was almost as sensitive as her bladder… Almost.

Iris soared deeper into the underworld. She glided above the River Styx and past the Judgment Pavilion. She soon flew over the Fields of Punishment. There came the screams of hundreds of tortured souls. Iris soon made her way down the pit and found herself flapping down into Tartarus.

The air of Tartarus was foul. It smelled of sulfur. Almost like old urine. That thought did not improve the state of Iris’ bladder. Fires burned across a field of broken glass and torn apart bones. Screams filled the thick air and monster howls were as loud as Dionysus’ drunken banquets.

Once in hell, Iris quickly located the prison cells. Iris - having visited her twin sister once before - found her cell rather quickly.

Sitting with her back facing the bars, was a dark goddess with silver wings and a black toga. Her skin was even more tan than Iris’ and her hair flowed in a fountain of chocolate, different from Iris’ blonde. Despite being twin sisters, Iris and Arke looked nothing alike. They acted nothing alike either.

“Hey,” Iris spoke up.

Arke owl turned her head. “Well, well, well, look who is here. Twin sister, kiss up to Zeus!” Arke lifted herself up and flapped her wings over to the bars.

“I am not Zeus’ kiss-up,” Iris snarled.

“Oh, that’s right. Hermes is Zeus’ kiss-up. You, dear sister, are the kiss-up to Hera. How silly of me!” Arke slapped her noggin like she was unable to believe how ridiculous she had sounded a moment ago.

“You are one to talk,” Iris sniffed. “You supported Kronos in the war! I may be Zeus and Hera’s kiss up, but you were a pretty big kiss up to Kronos!”

“Kronos was the right side to be on.”

“Kronos ate his children!”

“Yeah, well, maybe his children deserved it.”

Iris knew it was pointless to argue with Arke. Her twin sister had a way of winning disputes. And so, Iris ended the argument with, “Just know this, Arke… You can say what you want, but the fact of the matter is, while you are alone down here in your prison inside Hell itself, I am up there, serving the gods as their loyal messenger. The gods were so pleased with how I delivered messages for them during the war, they wanted me to be their messenger on a daily basis! Meanwhile, you acted as Kronos’ messenger for the titans. And the titans lost and here you are in prison while I party with the gods!”

To Iris’ surprise, Arke didn’t have a rebuttal. Arke just kept her back to the cell door, folded her arms, and floated a few feet off the ground. Arke looked back at Iris, her eyes filled with sorrow. Iris truly hated to see her sister like this. Arke was her twin sister after all. But Arke had taken the side of the titans during the Titanomachy. And maybe the gods are not the nicest of people, the titans were pretty bad themselves. Iris still supported the gods just as much as Arke supported the titans. Both sisters knew they supported bad people - but given both sides were kind of evil in their own ways - they were each still happy with the side they had picked all those years ago.

“Do you have meaning for your visit,” Arke snapped at her twin sister.

Iris fished around in her mail bag and produced a scroll which she continued to unroll. The rainbow goddess read aloud, “‘Arke, in response to your request to be set free, the Council of Olympian Gods has decided to deny such a request and allow you to stay in Tartarus. During the events of the Titanomachy, you betrayed the gods’ trust by sneaking away from their camp and joining Kronos and his allies. You acted as Kronos’ messenger and did everything within your power to grant the gods’ worst enemy victory of the war. We fear you have not yet grown out of these evil characteristics. Therefore, we shall be keeping you in Tartarus for the unforeseeable future.’”

Iris expected Arke to throw a tantrum. Honestly, Iris probably would have been in her position. Instead, Arke kept her cool and simply said, “Was it necessary to read all that aloud? Why not just tell me the gods are keeping me here?”

Iris rolled up the scroll and pocketed it in her satchel. “I suppose I could have. But Hera told me to read the scroll, so…”

Arke then said something Iris had not expected… “How are mom and dad?”

Iris flinched. She had no idea Arke cared. Then again, they are her parents as well. Of course, she cared. “Good,” Iris replied. “Dad recently discovered a new type of coral that glows in the dark, and mom created a new hue of cloud.” Iris and Arke’s father, Thaumas god of the wonders of the sea, was always discovering new… Wonders of the sea! And their mother, Electra was one of Oceanus and Thetys’ three thousand daughters. Electra was also the goddess of amber-tinted clouds and loved to invent new colors and hues of cloud. Yeah, Iris and Arke had two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine aunts. A big family to say the least!

“How are the harpies,” Arke asked, referring to her and Iris’ sisters.

“Good,” Iris replied. “You know them… Like stealing food from mortals. Zeus actually recently gave them a job. He wants them to steal food from this one mortal named Phineas.”

“Yikes, what did he do?”

“Phineas is a son of Poseidon and he has the gift of prophecy. He told the mortals what the gods were planning. Zeus got angry and blinded him. He also told our sisters to steal all of Phineas’ food and leave him only enough to survive.”

“Zeus is rather forgiving, isn’t he?”

“Hey, I never said Zeus was a kind man,” Iris retorted.

“Well, good for our sisters anyway. Now those bird ladies can do what they do best, steal food! I remember how they always took my sandwiches.”

Iris smirked. “Yeah, you made sandwiches that stretched to the heavens!”

“With extra pickles and mustard.”

“And our sisters would constantly snatch them from you before you even took a bite!”

“That is one of the key reasons I switched to Kronos’ side,'' Arke joked.

“What? He promised you endless sandwiches.”

“He promised me my sisters would stop stealing my food,” Iris shot back.

The twins laughed, just like old times, just like before the Titan War even started.

Arke’s smile came and went like the rays of the sun. Arke stared at her sister, legs crossed under her, hands holding those tired legs up, a bulge around her stomach area. Arke’s face finally settled upon a grin.

“Are you in the middle of a hold?” Arke demanded.

Iris knew it was pointless to fib at this point. Arke could see everything. Plus, despite their differences, Arke was Iris’ sister. And Arke was the only one that knew of the rainbow goddess’ fetish.

“Kinda,” Iris curled her legs and held them close so she hovered above the ground in a ball.

Arke held her head back and hollered with giggles. “Oh, sis, haven’t changed a bit,” Arke laughed. “How long has this been going on?” Arke wagged a finger up and down in between the bars to indicate Iris’ present situation.

“Like eleven days.”

“Eleven days, wow,” Arke breathed. Arke playfully swung around on the bars of her cell. “Are you gonna be able to hold it?”

“I’m gonna try…”

“You better hold it!” Arke warned sharply. “You are a big goddess. Big goddesses don’t pee themselves, now. Plus, as I understand it, dear sister, you are on the clock. You can’t wet yourself! Imagine Zeus and Hera’s reactions… Flying back to Olympus, your skirt completely soaked and reeking of urine. The gods might stick you in diapers. If they can’t trust you to hold your bladder, how can they trust you to deliver their mail!”

Iris knew the gods wouldn’t fire her just for having some incontinence. But it would be humiliating, nonetheless. Iris kind of enjoyed having Arke tease her. It was just like the days before the Titan War. Iris would hold her pee as a way to arouse herself, and Arke - the only one that knew - would taunt her.

“I miss you,” Iris admitted. “Why did you have to support the titans?”

Arke shrugged. “They seemed like the right side. At least with the titans, they have been around forever. We knew exactly how they acted. We had no idea what issues these new gods would bring with them. Zeus is always sexually assaulting people. Hera is a murderer. Poseidon dries up water and makes people go thirsty. Demeter starves the world just because she had a bad day. Aphrodite makes mortals and gods go crazy. I could go on. The titans are bad, sure, no one is saying they are the good guys. But at least we know what problems they brought with them.”

Iris hated to admit it, but that kind of made sense. Arke was always afraid of change.

“I had no idea you requested to be set free,” Iris said. “I’m sorry Zeus and the others turned you down.”

“Yeah, well,” Arke looked away. “I didn’t exactly think they would let me out. But I’ve gotten used to a life in Tartarus. Maybe one day the gods will set me free. In the meantime, tell mom, dad, and the harpies I said hi. You should go now.” Arke looked her sister up and down like a hero does to a monster. That comparison made Iris’ stomach churn and her bladder lurch towards the exit. “I suppose,” Arke snickered. “You have some enjoyment to get to!”

It was hard to enjoy herself now after seeing her twin sister still locked up in Tartarus. But Iris would try. Iris flew back to Olympus at the speed of visible light on the spectrum. Leaving a trail of rainbow behind her, Iris zipped from Tartarus out of the underworld across the mortal plains and back to Olympus. Iris flew straight into her sleeping chambers and slammed the door shut. She locked it and quickly fumbled with her skirt and toga.

The fast movements made Iris’ bladder beg to be released. The rainbow goddess felt a few drops roll past her fatigued sphincter muscle. Her bladder was hammering in her abdomen like Hephestus’ tools on metal. Iris had to keep her legs closed the entire time as she stripped naked.

Iris threw her staff and clothing in a pile at the foot of her bed. She slipped her toga over her wings and tossed it to the floor. Thinking ahead, Iris had already set out a mountain of towels before leaving for work this morning. Knowing Iris’ godly bladder, these towels wouldn’t be nearly enough to soak up all of her liquid. But they were better than nothing. Iris knew the cleanup would suck. But she didn’t care in the slightest right now.

Fully naked, the rainbow goddess held herself in the air, her wings flapping like a butterfly’s. Iris ran her hands over the naked bump jutting from her tummy. The rainbow goddess bit down on her lip with such force, she could feel ichor - the golden blood of the gods - emerge from the tooth piercings and soak her tongue. Just running her hands along her rock-hard bladder, Iris could feel herself seconds from cumming. Her bladder was the size of the Chimera’s head! It’s lion head that is. Iris’ navel stood out so far, so distended, filled with her sweat like Typhon’s eyeball when he watches Saturday night rom-com. Iris’ bladder was so gigantic, her wings could hardly hold her up anymore. Iris felt like she was lifting up a full-grown griffin with two feathers.

Iris hovered herself over to her bed and plopped down onto her towel mountain. Iris spread her legs as far as they would go. Just moving her legs away from each other was enough to force her overworked bladder to eject a small trickle of urine. Iris could feel the golden stuff ooze past her lips and onto the towels below her.

Iris placed two fingers firmly on her clitoris and began spinning it around in counterclockwise circles. Iris moaned and allowed her head to slam against her pillows. The rainbow goddess knew her walls were soundproof, but she still held back her screams. Keeping herself quiet, not making any noise, it just added to the sexual tension racing through the rainbow goddess’ veins.

Iris’ godly brain was numb with delight. The heavy rock-like texture of her bladder was enough to send her over the edge. Iris’ clit buzzed in between her fingers like a bumble bee on alcohol. Iris chewed her lips fiercely, drawing more ichor. Sweat gushed down her face and legs. Her bladder - the size of Gaia’s best mountains - even poured sweat like rivers among the hills. Tears of joy and a pleasant type of pain filled the rainbow goddess’ irises.

Iris rolled her clitoris this way and that. Beads of urine shot from her like a sprinkler out of control. Iris moaned heavily and felt her pleasure meter rocket to the top, her heart slowing down and her brain shutting off. Adrenaline coursed through her immortal body as the rainbow goddess experiences two amazing sensations all at once. She peed. And she orgasmed.

Iris’ eyes grew into stars as her breath was captured by her throat. A thick jet of white hot goo blasted from her vulva and dotted the towels like the melting snow of a springtime mountain. Immediately following the ejaculation was a rapid of piss. Blazing hot urine shot from Iris’ pussy. The rainbow goddess - wishing to prolong the moment - forced her sphincter to close and open, close and open. Iris shot out just a little bit of pee at a time. But finally, her immortal body had had enough and involuntarily caused Iris to drain all over her towel mountain.

Iris held her head back. Her face was a mix of sweat, tears, and droll. Her golden hair was plastered to the bed behind her. Her golden ichor had dried to form a thick layer of crust over her factual lips. Meanwhile, Iris’ pussy lips were busy ejecting eleven days' worth of urine all at once.

The river of piss was so hot when it touched down on the towels, a slab of steam rose into the air. GLOOUUK. The urine sounded distorted and out of focus. All though, that may have just been the ringing in Iris’ ears. The rainbow goddess saw colors. A look - only to describe as orgasmic - crossed her face. This was one of the best orgasms the rainbow deity has ever had! Iris panted and trembled and finally relaxed as she lay in bed and peed and peed for several long moments.

To most gods, the orgasmic feeling of releasing a painfully full bladder goes away after a few minutes of peeing. But to Iris, Iris was aroused right up until the last second of her stream.

The sundial in the corner of the room had moved a great deal by the time Iris’ bladder had shrunk down to a natural size. Iris peed for several moments after.

Finally, her stream turned into a trickle and was good. The once pearl towels were now a slate gray and every inch of them was covered. The air stunk of eleven-day-old piss, but it was a smell that only made Iris wish to touch herself again.

Iris lay in bed, one hand on her clit, the other on her bladder. Iris didn’t play with herself, she just kept her hands there as if prepared for what awaited her next. Iris’ eyes shut. She felt her brain tingle like a hand or foot that has fallen asleep. Iris’ mind was drifting off and she could feel Hypnos - the god of sleep - doing his job.

Suddenly, Iris heard a noise that woke her up like a bucket of freezing River Leche water. The doorknob jiggled.

Iris sat upright. No one could enter. The door was locked! She just had to be quite… Then, the door opened! And in stepped…

“Oh,” Zephyrus god of the west wind blushed at his wife. “You having some fun?”

Iris smirked, relieved it was only her husband. “Step in before the whole world sees me,” she giggled. And so the west wind did.

Zephyrus closed and relocked the door and pocketed their bedroom key. He climbed onto the large bed and lay beside his nude wife. Zephyrus rested his head on her breast and twirled his finger in circles on her bare tummy.

“You have some fun with your omorashi stuff?” asked the west wind.

“I did,” replied the rainbow goddess.

“You want to have some fun with me?” Zephyrus sounded sad like he feared a negative answer.

“You know I am always up to playing with you, babe,” Iris replied. Zephyrus’ frown flipped on its head. And the two gods slid under the covers and began foreplay.

Between the extra sexual release and the release of a monster piss, Iris was so overjoyed, she promised herself, after sexual intercourse with her man, she would give the whole world a rainbow. Iris had a tendency to create rainbows for the world when she was extra happy. And right now… She was extra happy!

*033*2023-04-05 19:13

Switching over to Egyptian mythology, I have written a story about Isis the Egyptian goddess of magic, healing, and motherhood.

Isis stood on a large sandy hill overlooking the city of Alexandria. Isis’ red, blue, and green wings flapped in the light breeze. Her feet lifted off the ground, one at a time, allowing her upper legs to press into her vagina, one after the other. Isis reached above her noggin and carefully removed her headdress of ram’s horns which houses a glowing orange sphere of light inside. It was her famous sun disk headdress which her great-grandfather, Ra had given her.

Isis uncomfortably pressed the ram’s horns and sphere to her pussy, shoving it deep inside her genitalia as a way to hold on longer.

Headdress inside her lady bits, the goddess of magic turned and faced the flowing Nile River right beside her. Isis closed her eyes and listened to the Nile flow. The rushing river rapids moved delicately but swiftly. The river was fast, but it wasn’t too powerful. As Isis listened to the flowing water, her four-week full bladder was driven crazy with pee delight. Isis wanted to pee so badly. And it was such a glorious feeling indeed! Isis couldn’t imagine a better sensation than the one she currently experienced.

The goddess of magic simply loved the feeling of an organ as heavy as a stone wheel pressing down on her clit. The goddess was immensely aroused.

Isis held her legs closed, keeping her headdress pressed tightly up to her goddesshood. With her now free hands, Isis placed her Ankh - the symbol of life statue - in one hand, and with the other, she waved her hand in a circle and conjured up a chalice out of thin air. The sky-blue cup was overflowing with grape juice. Isis temporarily held her Ankh in between her teeth. This allowed her to wave her spare hand over the chalice which glowed bright blue. Isis amplified the effects of her grape juice - which was already considered a diuretic - tenfold.

Grinning, already squirming at the effects, Isis removed her Ankh from her lips and downed the grape juice, making sure to suck down every last drop. In only a couple of minutes, Isis’ thirst was quenched and the chalice had run dry. Wanting even more of a challenge, Isis used her magic to refill the cup two more times, and each time, she gave extra diuretic effects to the grape juice.

Even though Isis only drank three cups, thanks to her magic, it was more like drinking thirty cups!

Isis could already feel the effects take hold of her bulging-out bladder. Breathing heavily, Isis began to run her hands over her swollen stomach. Her stomach was bulging so far out, anyone would assume she was nearing the end of a pregnancy.

Tossing her empty chalice over her shoulder into the sand, Isis shoved her headdress even farther into her crotch. Squirming and wiggling and moaning, the goddess of magic stretched her hand towards the river. Out of the river sprang two streams of water. The water flowed through the air, riding on the currents of Isis’ sorcery and each of the streams entered one of Isis’ ear canals.

Isis’ ear drums were coated in the noise of trickling water. Isis’ bladder grew numb from the stress of holding. Isis crossed her legs into a triple knot. Her toes were crossed in the sand, her sandals tip-tap-tapping.

Maneuvering her hips back and forth, Isis jammed her headdress as far up her vagina as it would go. The goddess of motherhood rubbed her hands together, whispering a soft spell onto them. Her fingertips began to glow with blinding light. Isis lightly pressed down on her bladder. The magic in her fingertips seeped through her exposed skin and entered her incredibly rock-hard belly. The strands of witchcraft the goddess used entered her bladder, filling it to its huge captivity. Isis could feel the hardness of her organ sitting on her pelvis, making her clit buzz with enjoyment.

Isis had never been so desperate. Those drinks were already entering her system. In no time, she would be feeling the brunt of the attack. Isis felt as if a pile of limestone was pressing into her abdomen. The pressure was the most erotic sensation of them all.

Now, for the best part. Holding her headdress to her pussy, Isis transformed into a mortal woman. Her wings drew into her back. Isis also used her magic to make her Ankh and headdress vanish into thin air. Those were the symbols most often associated with Isis. If anyone saw her with them, they would know she was a goddess in disguise. Isis’ Ankh and headdress were safely stored in the Duat for later use, the goddess held her crotch the old-fashioned way with her bare hands. She squeezed and held. Then, she began to waddle down the sand hill and into the city of Alexandria, all while watery noises flowed inside her brain.

Isis knew this was wrong. This was awful of her. To take advantage of these mortals… Well, she wasn’t really taking advantage of them, now was she? Isis never knew what it was… But nothing excited her more than being fully desperate for a piss with others watching her and staring. Isis just wanted the mortals to look at her and gawk at her bloated bladder and be impressed when she exploded all over the city. But it wasn’t fair to the mortals. They had no idea a goddess was wandering their city while intentionally holding her pee, getting a sick kick out of others watching her struggle.

Isis knew she needed to stop this. She did this all the time. But it was too exciting for her. She was addicted. Isis intentionally held her pee for four weeks while drinking vast amounts of fluid the entire time. Her immortal kidneys haven't had a rest that entire time. And now they had thirty cups of grape juice to filter. Fortunately, Isis was a goddess, so she could not do any damage to herself physically. But this was still wrong of her to do to the poor mortals.

Maybe it wasn’t so bad. It wasn’t like Isis was harming the mortals in any way. But she still felt guilty. If the mortals knew that she, Isis, the protector of mothers, children, and the dead, acted in such a vial manner, would they still worship her the way they do? Isis was the one who taught mortals how to weave baskets, brew beer, and bake bread. Would the mortals still hold her to such high regard if they knew her disgraceful secret fantasy? And what of the other gods? Would they be disgusted by Isis’ despicable nature? She couldn’t risk anyone finding out.

This is the LAST time I do this, Isis told herself. It was a lie. She told herself this constantly. It was never enough. She knew she would be back here next month. If not Alexandria, another city. She could never get enough.

The only one who knew of this awful act was Isis’ husband, Osiris lord of the underworld. And thanks to Set (god of chaos and deserts) murdering Osiris, Osiris was no longer in this realm. He was in the underworld now. Isis still visited of course. But she saw her husband much less these days.

How Isis hated her evil brother, Set. She hoped her son, Horus (god of revenge and pharaohs) would put an end to Set’s rein soon.

Isis has already assisted Horus in many ways. There was the time Isis tricked Set into eating Horus’ semen which she laid on Set’s favorite lettuce plant. Set ate the lettuce and Horus’ semen along with it. Set then became pregnant with Horus’ heir and became a laughingstock of the gods. (Hey, the gods can do anything. The males can even become pregnant!) There was also the time Isis fired a harpoon at Horus and Set who were wrestling in the form of hippopotamuses. Unfortunately, despite having aimed for Set, Isis ended up striking her own son instead.

There was also the time that Isis transformed into a beautiful woman and seduced Set, forcing him to admit in front of all the other gods how he usurped the throne from Osiris. The battle between Horus and Set was age-old. Hopefully, Horus would defeat Set one day. But as of now, Isis needed to take a break from all of that nonsense and just unwind with some good old-fashioned desperation fun. And the mortals would unknowingly help her with that!

As bad as Isis felt for the oblivious mortals, the excitement inside her antagonizing bladder was so extreme, all of her guilt washed away like the sand banks of the Nile. Isis wore nothing but a short skirt and a linen kalasiris - an ancient form of bra - so as not to get overheated from the harsh desert air. Isis’ tanned skin was exposed to the world as was her bouncing bulge or rock-hard piss.

Isis was hobbling through the streets, her short black hair swaying in the harsh desert winds. Isis had her hands shoved up her skirt. She groped her hairy vulva. The goddess felt her forest of pubes against her fingers. That only turned her on even more.

As Isis waddled through the streets of Alexandria, many heads turned. Everyone saw Isis grab her crotch and pee dance up and down the streets. Having all eyes on her was the most exhilarating feeling in the cosmos. Isis hoped they would all be around to watch her eruption later on.

The goddess of magic went waddling up to a man who stood on the third highest rung of a ladder, using a hammer to nail a board on his roof. Isis imagined he was sealing up a leak. She imagined this attractive mortal banging his hammer against her urethral opening, making sure there were no dribbles. Isis gasped in a flurry of thrills.

“Excuse me, sir,” Isis called.

The man looked down from his room.

This was it, time to oversell it. Granted, Isis didn’t need to oversell anything! That heavy grape juice had caught up with her. Adding to her four-week-old swimming pool of urine, Isis was ready to blow her lid.

Isis kept her hands wedged up her skirt. With her knees pressed together, she hopped from side to side on each foot. Isis wore the most desperate expression as possible. The one of a lady ready to birth a pee baby. That wasn’t hard to do given her seriously desperate state. The experience of this man watching her was dazzling. To have his eyes explore her naked bulge and her frantic movements. Isis felt two different bodily urges mixed into one.

“Would you be so kind as to tell me where I can find the nearest toilet?” Isis asked.

Asking for the toilet while having a distended belly and doing an intense bathroom dance all while a stranger stared at her… Isis had never been so aroused!

Please say you don’t know, please say you don’t know, Isis begged. She wanted to ask every mortal in this city where to find a toilet. She wished so badly that one didn’t exist! She wished she would have to hold this load forever while the entire city watched her dance and squirm and wiggle in place. Isis silently crossed her fingers, hoping this man would tell her she was out of luck.

This was not Isis’ lucky day. The man quickly scuttled down from his ladder and told the desperate magic goddess, “You may use my toilet if you wish. It looks urgent.” Even though he didn’t call Isis out on it, Isis clearly saw his eyes drift for just a moment and observed her pregnant bulge. Seriously, Isis was beginning to look more bloated than when she carried around an infant Horus inside her belly.

Isis was frozen. Normally, she would be very grateful for a mortal’s hospitality. The gods often wondered if mortals would be kind to them even if they disguised themselves as mortals. Here Isis was disguised as a mortal woman, and this man was willing to give her sanctuary. While this showed this gentleman as a kind man, it did little for Isis’ excitement. Fortunately, she had a plan for this.

“Um… No offense… I appreciate the offer and all,” Isis managed, jumping all over the street. “But I feel uncomfortable using a stranger’s lavatory. Is there a public one I can use, by any chance?”

The man pursed his lips. Admiring Isis’ pee pee dance, he said, “Doesn’t look like you’re in a position to be picky right now. But there’s a public bathroom right down that road,” he pointed down a side street.

“Thank you,” Isis hobbled off. Isis’ senses were fluttering faster than her godly wings ever could. That was the most arousing feeling talking to an attractive man about bathrooms while dancing. Isis wished it didn't have to end, but dragging it out would have made him suspicious. But Isis had other tricks up her sleeve.

Isis’ bladder was at its max. The roaring of water was still bellowing in her head. Her brain felt like it was an island in a sea of gold. Her urine remained caged up inside her bladder walls, begging for a spot to empty. Isis could feel the ten times of grape juice move swiftly through her kidneys and flow down her ureters. Her urge was rising steadily. After four weeks with zero alleviation breaks, Isis was already stretching her limits. Soon, she would create her very own personal oasis of yellow.

Time for round two!

Isis squirmed her way up to two chatting handsome men with neat beards and muscles. Isis had a tendency to navigate towards the attractive men of the cities she frequented with her urgent bladder needs.

One of the men sat on the windowsill of a nearby house while the other leaned against the wall. They were nothing but loincloths and they were in heavy conversation regarding the weather. (Which was always hot and dry!)

“Hey, boys,” Isis stood before the men. She had two fists raised at her side and was marching her feet up and down in the sands. The two men looked over. “I have to pee!” Isis shouted.

The two men exchanged looks for a solid two heartbeats. Looking back at Isis, the man on the windowsill said, “Do you need directions to the bathrooms?”

Still marching, Isis shook her head. “I want to pee,” she repeated.

The men looked at one another again. The looks they gave one another made Isis’ godly clitoris turn into a firm stone. They were judging Isis, confused at what she was asking. Maybe they were even a little uncomfortable… Good! Just what Isis liked to see. She was such a cruel goddess…

“Okay, the bathrooms are down that way, ma’am,” the man against the wall pointed.

Isis shoved her hands up her skirt again and continued to move her feet up and down in desperation. “I really have to use the toilet!” Isis cried.

The two men blinked and looked at each other and eyed Isis’ disguise.

“Do you need help making it?” the man against the wall asked.

“Or do you want to go inside my place,” windowsill man pointed through the open window carving.

“I really need a wee!” Isis crossed her legs into a tight ribbon. Bobbing up and down with her hands mixed in the pile of legs, she gnawed at her lower lip, making her eyes wide to show how urgent this urination was.

The two men stared at each other for what felt like one-quarter of a millennium. Finally, their gaze broke from each other and they looked at Isis - who was now sitting on her bum on the ground, knees to stomach, rocking back and forth with the most desperate of expressions on her face.

“Ma’am, I’m sorry, but I don’t know what you want us to do,” said the man on the window.

The second man began, “If you need us to help you walk…”

Isis lay on her side, her hands buried in her crotch, legs crossed tight, bulge protruding into the sand, and whole body shaking. “I need to pee so bad…” Isis moaned.

The two men held eye contact so long, Ra’s sun boat moved several miles across Nut [the sky goddess]’s body. When they looked at Isis again, the man against the wall inched forward. The man on the windowsill climbed down. They slowly reached for Isis as though to help her up. Instead, Isis rolled from side to side moaning over and over again, “I gotta pee, I gotta pee, I gotta pee…”

“Ma’am, we can’t help you if…” the first man started.

“I feel like I’m gonna burrrrrrst!” Isis shouted, extending the R sound. Isis remained on her back, hands upskirt, eyes staring into the harsh light of Ra.

Giving up, the two men stood up straight and rushed away.

Isis had tears running in rivers onto the ground, moistening the otherwise dry sands of Egypt. The tears were real. The pressure was the strongest Isis has felt in years. This experience was so arousing. Those two men looked at her like she was a chorus of scarab beetles singing in perfect harmony.

But isis wasn’t done yet. She still had a whole lot of horniness to get out of her system.

Isis decided to take a break from just men and danced up to a group of people - both men and women - who sat on the side of the street playing a board game.

Isis flew up to them so quickly, her entire form turned into a blur of light as she did so. “BATHROOOOOOOOM!!!” Isis bellowed, her hands hidden up her pure white skirt.

Isis could literally feel a pulse in her vagina area. Pressure collected on her pussy. Isis now held four weeks' worth of nectar as well as the thirty grape juice containers she had a little while ago. The pressure skyrocketed in a matter of seconds as the last bits of juice filled Isis’ already-packed urinary bladder. Her stomach was so stretched, there were marks on it. Isis commanded the water noises to increase inside her ears. She felt an ocean swishing about inside her divine body. But that was nothing compared to the arousal she felt at having this group study her, surprised by her bold behavior and her frantic moves.

Isis knocked her knees all about, swaying her hips, grabbing herself with the left hand and then the right, angrily pulling on her pubes and dropping curly hairs into the sand where the small crowd could see them. The men and women instantly switched from surprise to concern for this poor woman.

“Ma’am,” one of the women stood. “You look extra bloated. Are you pregnant?”

“Sitra!” the only other woman in the group shouted.

“What?” asked Sitra. “She must be having a hard time holding due to her pregnancy.”

“Yes, but you don’t need to point out she’s bloated,” the second woman lectured.

Isis could feel excitement coursing through her veins. These people truly thought her to be expecting. And she was… She was expecting a urinary explosion soon!

“Please…” Isis stammered, forcing her voice to come out weak and trembling. Isis skipped around in front of the group of four. “Find me a b… B… Bathroom… I need a toilet!” Isis crossed one leg in front of the other and jammed her hands so far up her skirt, her wrists disappeared.

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” one of the men spoke quickly, realizing there was little time left for this ‘pregnant’ woman to find salvation. “The restrooms are a bit off. Do you want to go behind a building?”

In the lands of Egypt, public urination - male and female - is a very common thing. Asking Isis if she wanted to piss outside was a fair suggestion in these times.

Still refusing to end her play session, Isis replied, “I normally would, but you know… Pregnant,” she rubbed her enlarged stomach. “I can’t squat.”

“You could always spread your lips and stand,” Sitra suggested. “That’s what I do. Just face a wall, hold your lips yah distance apart, piss.” Sitra demonstrated by holding two fingers in front of her own sundress.

“Thanks for the suggestion,” Isis had one leg raised and moved it up and down her opposite leg as though she had an itch. “But I’m no good at that either… I have to go so, so… So b… Badly…” Pretending to fall, Isis grabbed her knees and bent over. She could feel her giant bladder pressing into her legs. It hurt in the most pleasurable way imaginable.

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” the second man looked concerned. “I don’t know what to do… we can knock on someone’s door and ask…”

“No, no, I won’t be a… A b… A bother…” Isis choked out. “I won’t m… Make it to the b… Bathroom either t… Though.”

The four friends eyed each other, digging for solutions. One of the men looked down at the large wooden game board. Examining the wall behind him, leading against it was a saw and a shovel. “Ehoou, bring those tools over here,” the man commanded. “I have an idea.”

Normally, this was the part where Isis refuses the easy solution for some reason and runs off to attack someone else with her urinary needs. But this man’s plan was so daring, it was just the kind of thing an aroused Isis couldn’t pass up. A solution this hot and spicy only came around once in a lifetime. And for a goddess, that meant something!

The man named Ehoou dragged over the shovel and the saw. The second man - named Harsiesis asked Ehoou to hold the giant wooden game board while he cut a hole in the center. He then asked the second woman - named Anta - to use the shovel to gather a large pile of sand. Sitra, meanwhile, would search for sticks and rope and set up a stand for them all.

“Just hang on a little longer, ma’am,” Harsiesis cried, quickly sawing through his own game board. Isis honestly felt bad for these poor mortals. Here they were helping some total stranger. If they knew she was the divine, that would be different. But as far as they knew, she was just some pregnant woman in need of assistance. And they were willing to sacrifice their game board like that to assist her!

The gang did their respective jobs. Sitra tied sticks to rope, creating a stand. Anta gathered a large pile of sand below said stand. Harsiesis finished his work, having successfully created a hole large enough for Isis’ bum in their game board. Ehoou quickly set the ruined game board over the stand Anta had built.

Isis had to hand it to them, they worked quickly. Upon knowing relief was so close, Isis felt ready to explode almost as if this were for real. She felt a mallet hammering against her sphincter, ready to dislodge it out of place and thus open the floodgates. And when that happened, she would shower everything. Speaking of, Isis feared what would happen when she unleashed her beast of a bladder. These poor mortals expected her to have a bladder the size of a pregnant mortal. The pile of sand Anta gathered was perfect for that. But for a goddess… Not even close!

On that note, believe it or not, but this is what toilets looked like in ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian toilets were literally a stand that held a plank of wood that had a hole in the center and a pile of sand under it to catch urine and feces. Harsiesis, Anta, Sitra, and Ehoou worked with very limited resources, but they managed to make a replica of any toilet found across the plains of ancient Egypt.

Isis wanted to cry. These people were so nice and so resourceful! Even if Isis was just pretending with them, she would have to reward them! But shedding her disguise was out of the question. She could not let mortals know who she was. What would become of her reputation?

Isis had tears, just like the kind she used to create the Nile River. (Yes, long story short, when Set killed Osiris, Isis’ husband, Isis cried so much she created the very Nile River itself). And she was ready to cry a second one!

“Go ahead, ma’am,” Harsiesis said, standing back.

“We can…” Ehoou was just about to suggest that he and his friends give her some privacy. But if Isis was going to do this, she needed all eyes on her! And again, public urination was no big deal in these days. Hence why the group left their homemade toilet out in the open, on the side of the street.

Isis charged forward, suddenly feeling the full gravity of her desperation. Isis spun around, threw her skirt up, and plopped down, holding her bum over the hole in the wood. The stand Sitra built creaked a little, but it held just fine.

Isis spread her legs wide - pretending it was out of urgency, but really just wanting the crew to watch her gush. Isis’ pussy lips flapped for all to see. And from deep within, came a jet of piss like no other. A jet of urine the size of a giant’s tear ducts fired from Isis’ labia. The nearly clear stream smashed the sand to shreds. Isis’ pee tore through the sand in a matter of seconds. The strongest pressure stream that anyone had ever seen gushed from Isis’ aching piss hole. Her pissy lips fired urine below her butt and soaked the large pile of sand gathered by Anta. The sand pile had previously been several inches in height. Now, the mound was a flat thicket of mud and clay. Isis’ stream was so powerful, it broke the record of the ancient world.

Isis allowed her head to hang back. The change in internal pressure was the most orgasmic thing Isis had ever felt in any of her lives. (The Egyptian gods have been reincarnated a multitude of times). With a geyser between her separated legs, Isis moaned in bliss. Euphoria filled her noggin. Her entire body buzzed like the desert locusts at night.

“RELIEF!” Isis shouted. “MAN, THAT HITS THE SPOT!!!” Isis was well aware she was shouting. That was kind of her intention.

“Feeling better, ma’am?” Ehoou asked politely, unable to take his eyes from the disguised goddess’ sprout.

“YOU BET I AM!” cried a relieved Isis. Nothing better than all of that pressure zipping out of her genitals in a long, wet flood. That reminded Isis, she better cool it or she would flood all of Egypt! But this feeling felt too grand! How could Isis possibly control herself now that she had a taste of this blessed relief? How grand it was! This piss certainly was fit for a goddess!

Isis had already pissed so powerfully, she washed away the entire pile of sand scooped by Anta.

The four friends took a few nervous steps back as they watched Isis flood the entire street. Isis shot piss wildly from her pussy, directly through the hole under her, causing a sinkhole in the desert floor ten inches below her butt. Isis allowed the super-powerful grape juice to drain along with every other blasted drink she had consumed over the past month.

As Isis urinated away, one by one, citizens of Alexandria noticed the trail of wet sand flowing across the entire city. Soon, a crowd gathered to investigate and gawk at the powerful pissing woman. The crowd started off with just a few stunned faces here and there. But in no time, half the residents of Alexandria had crowded around, peeking over one another’s shoulders, staring at the source of such a pee.

Isis pretended not to notice all the people gathered to watch her wee. Could this whole adventure get any more arousing!?! Isis spent several more minutes spraying the sands below her. With each minute that passed with no end in sight, the crowd looked more and more perplexed. By the time Isis reached half an hour of a straight gush, the crowd had grown so wide, the entire street was packed with people wishing to get a glimpse at the urinating marvel.

Isis quickly learned the flaw in her fantasy. It was the same flaw that happened every time she did this. No mortal could pee for half an hour with such high pressure. Mortals may be dumb, but they’re not that dumb. Even mortal brains can understand one simple truth. In order to pee like this, the person had to be a goddess!

Isis heard the rumors fly around like hornets. The crowd whispered to one another, surprised by the powerful gushing woman who was nothing more than a goddess in disguise. But which one? That was the question. There were many goddesses in the Egyptian pantheon after all. Not to mention, gods can change form. Who’s to say this isn’t a male god taking the form of a woman? That would make sense. Even back in these days, while doable, women have always had a tougher time peeing outside than men. Perhaps a male divine took this form as a way to test the kindness of mortals and their willingness to help a stranger.

Isis heard everything from Thoth to Ra to Hathor to Nephthis. And yes, there were a few that suggested Isis. But unless Isis took away her disguise (which she never would) there was no way for the mortals to know. They would forever be in a state of not knowing the truth.

Isis was rounding forty-five minutes now and her urine rivers had covered all of Alexandria by now. Mortals stepped out of the way as trails flowed down the streets, turning sand into mud. The main source - the hole below Isis’ butt - was now just a three-inch deep crater of mud.

Now that her bladder was nearing its final stretch, Isis felt even happier than the time she tricked Ra into revealing his secret name. (Another long story, Isis once took Ra’s drool (taken while the sun god was napping) and used said drool with her magic to make a poisonous snake. The snake bit Ra and Isis - being a goddess of healing - was the only one who could cure him. She agreed to do so if he revealed his secret name Ra eventually did so, on the condition that Isis only trust the name with her son, Horus. Egyptian gods’ secret names are powerful. Hence why they are secret! You could destroy a god with the use of their secret name! Isis just wanted Ra’s secret name as leverage. You know, in case she ever needed it).

Isis’ once powerful gush slowed to a trickle. The trickling lasted for a few more minutes. Isis - while waiting - silently used her abilities to remove the water sounds from her ear. They had been so delightful when desperate, but now that she was empty, they were pretty much useless.

Isis shook her butt around to dribble the last of her liquid waste into the sand below. Isis stood and lowered her skirt. “Ahh…” She sighed. “Much better,” completely owning what she had just done. Isis knew what they would ask next. Her pregnant belly was gone and after a forty-five-minute urination that flooded the streets, there would be questions. Isis handled it the same way she always did whenever she did this.

“Yes, mortals,” she said. “I am a goddess. I wanted to test your hospitality. I am pleased to say, you all passed.” Turning to a shocked, Harsiesis, Anta, Ehoou, and Sitra, she added, “And while some of you came up with a flawless solution which you achieved through teamwork skills and resourcefulness,” addressing the crowd as a group. “Everyone I asked for help attempted to do so in the best way they knew how. I am a goddess, but I shall not reveal which one. That is as secret as a god’s secret name.”

The crowd began to whisper to one another. Isis smiled, knowing full well that even after she left, this city would be debating over which goddess came and pissed all throughout their beloved city.

“As thanks, I shall protect this city from any and all disasters,” Isis promised. “Also,” looking back to a dazed Sitra, Harsiesis, Ehoou, and Anta, she spoke, “I believe I owe you four a new game.” With a finger snap, a large wooden board appeared in their hands. Each member of the four found themselves holding a corner of the bright and shiny new game. “Thank you, mortals,” Isis said. “Now that my bladder is drained, I must be on my way.” Before anyone could say anything else, Isis vanished into a flash of light.

While Isis spoke the truth about wanting to test the mortal’s hospitality, that was only a small, small, small, tiny, microscopic part of the reason she did this.

But the mortals didn’t need to know that she did this as a way to turn herself on.

Now it was time to return to the heavens and masturbate to the thought of today’s events! The goddess of magic and motherhood sure would have some fun tonight!

*036*2023-04-10 15:55

Back to Greek mythology, I wrote a story about the heroine Atalanta. Atalanta is personally my all-time favorite Greek hero/heroine! From all she did to the Calydonian Boar Hunt to sailing with Jason and the Argonauts to her famous footrace, Atalanta has certainly earned her place in the hall of ancient Greek heroes!

Atalanta kept her legs crossed real tight, regretting the vast amounts of water she had consumed. Atalanta had spent her morning hunting rabbits and birds and deer. All of that hunting worked up a good thirst! As soon as she returned to her father’s palace, she sat down with an entire buffet of water. Atalanta had downed picture after picture, goblet after goblet of H2O. The water had been so delicious that she had been completely oblivious to how much she was drinking. She has also forgotten about the race being held today.

Atalanta now found herself standing in front of the race track, trying her hardest not to squirm. Surrounding Atalanta was an army of strong gentlemen, all of whom wished to take her hand. Atalanta couldn’t deny that it was flattering she had so many suitors. But after receiving that prophecy that her future marriage would be her downfall, she was completely turned off by the idea of marrying anyone.

What was wrong with the single life anyway? Atalanta had defeated a giant monstrous boar, sailed the seas with Jason and the Argonauts, defeated Peleus in a wrestling tournament in Iolcus, and had countless other heroic tasks. Atalanta just loved waking up in the morning and going on a solitary hunt. The last thing she needed was a husband to tie her down.

In retrospect, Atalanta was still a little hung up on Meleager. Meleager had been such a kind, handsome, heroic young man. And now he was dead. Atalanta would be telling the lie of the century if she said she didn’t still care for him. At this point in her life, Atalanta saw no reason to get married.

But all of these problems seemed trivial compared to what she had brewing inside her bladder.

Atalanta could feel swarms of pressure collecting directly on top of her sphincter. How she desired to take a piss break! Atalanta could always ask her father - the one orchestrating this event - for a quick bathroom break, but she knew he was under enough stress as it was. It was a difficult thing to try and prevent your child from getting married when they had a hundred or so suitors. Most fathers would happily send their daughters off to get married without a second thought. But as it was, the prophecy still hung in the air. King Iasus of Arcadia - Atalanta’s father - didn’t want Atalanta to endanger her existence any more than she did. Still, Atalanta’s bladder was about to be her downfall!

She would just have to be patient and hold. But the thought of running with a steaming waterlogged organ sloshing around inside seemed less than ideal.

Aside from hunting, archery, and marathoning, Atalanta was known to have an impressive bladder captivity. She used to have holding contests with the crew of the Argo. While all of the men would have to piss after a few hours, Atalanta could hold throughout the entire day. Normally, a few pints of water on her bladder was nothing to sweat over. But Atalanta hadn’t peed since noon yesterday. She meant to, of course, but she kept getting distracted. Like this morning, her satyr god friend Pan came to her and mentioned a drinking contest taking place in the woods.

Atalanta joined the festival in the woods of Arcadia and competed with the satyrs and nymphs. Atalanta drank twice as much beer as the rest of them combined. Beer was a beverage considered barbaric, but the nature spirits are a wild bunch.

If that’s not enough, Atalanta spent the entire morning hunting without a single break. She had been too engaged in the sport to stop even for a second. Now she was regretting it big time.

Atalanta isn’t one of those girls that gets goosebumps at the very idea of peeing in the woods. Atalanta has to go, she will gladly pop a squat behind a friendly bush. Heck, she was ready to squat here with everyone watching! But when Atalanta has her mind on something, she has a tendency to forget even the most basic of needs like breathing or peeing.

Now with twenty-six hours of piss storming inside her balloon, and beer and water churning around and around, Atalanta knew she would have to urinate soon.

Holding this much beer and water inside for so long would have been impossible for any mortal. Only the gods could hold back such a flood. Everyone always says Atalanta has the beauty of a goddess, so why not a bladder captivity as well?

Atalanta bent down and stretched her hands out on the dirt trail, lifting her rump in the air. The pressure inside forced Atalanta to lift her leg and jam it up her pee hole. Atalanta’s toga bunched up and her whole body was shaking. Beside her was the first suitor she was racing. The suitor was also in a starting position with his hands in the dirt and butt in the air.

The suitor glanced over at Atalanta, partly concerned, partly aroused. Atalanta could not show any signs of weakness. She had to show all of her suitors that she was not only a strong, independent woman, but she also had zero interest in marriage.

Atalanta could feel her bladder shake like an icicle about to fall. She chomped down on her lower lip, praying to the gods to allow her to hold on.

“On your mark, get set,” King Iasus called. “GO!”

Atalanta’s suitor jumped to his feet and sped down the track with feet of fire. Atalanta remained behind, counting to ten in her head. Atalanta was such an amazing runner, that one of the rules was, she had to give all of her contestants a head start of ten seconds. It was the only real way to make the race fair. And that’s not even bragging. If the ten-second head start didn’t exist, Atalanta would slaughter her opponent instantly. (Literally and figuratively).

Atalanta’s mental counter had reached six when she felt her overly full bladder stab her ribs. Atalanta winced in sheer pain. She had to do this. She could not allow herself to get married! While the idea of marriage in itself wasn’t the most appealing thing to Atalanta, it was even less ideal when she considered that rotten prophecy from the Oracle of Delphi. ‘Should Atalanta marry, she would face her downfall.’ Marriage was definitely off the table. So, Atalanta would have to crush her opponent. There was just no other option for her!

When Atalanta finished counting, she spotted her suitor at the halfway mark on the track. Time to show these boys what real running looks like!

Hunting knife enclosed in her fist, Atalanta flew across the track, her feet barely touching the soil. Atalanta’s hot bladder was bouncing up and down, up and down inside. Atalanta felt as though she was dragging around a two-ton pumpkin behind her. It was weighing her down and she so badly wanted to let go of it, just drop it into the dirt. But she couldn’t. She had to take that heavy item with her wherever she went.

Thankful that no one could see her on this section of the track, Atalanta stuffed her free hand down her toga, cupping her pussy with all the strength she had. Atalanta squeezed herself, giving herself as little relief as she possibly could.

The suitor had made it to the three-quarter mark just as Atalanta rounded the bend onto the second half of the track.

With disappointment, Atalanta knew she had to let go of herself now. She was once again in full view of the awe-inspired crowd. Disappointingly dropping her hand to her side, and pumping it through the air, Atalanta quickened her pace, zipping across the plain like a cheetah that drank a speed potion.

The suitor was nearly at the finish line. Atalanta’s heavy burden bubbled and hissed inside her belly. Atalanta’s stomach was inflated with the massive thing. The pressure was driving her nuts. She sucked it up and gave herself another burst of speed. The next thing that happened, Atalanta caught up to her suitor and plunged her knife directly into his back. That was the bet. Any man brave enough raced Atalanta, but if she caught up to him before he finished the track, he paid with his life.

The crowd cheered for Atralanta as she ended the life of yet another suitor. Atalanta imagined how good it would feel to do the potty dance right now. She could just knit her knees together and hop around like a drunk bunny. But she refused to have people see her like that.

“Very good, Atalanta,” Iasus said with pride in his daughter. Clapping, the king then said, “Ready for your next race?”

Atalanta knew the wise thing would have been to ask for a break. But after all the work she has done to prove to everyone - including herself - that she is a strong woman, she found herself replying, “Bring on the next suitor.”

So, Atalanta once again spent her day racing and murdering suitor after suitor. Even with a bladder the size of a dragon’s kidney, Atalanta was still the fastest marathoner in Greece. Her bladder was constantly stinging her very essence, but she somehow managed to not leak a single drop.

The worst part was for sure the bouncing her bladder had to endure as she pounded across the race track. Atalanta spent the first section of track slyly holding her privates. This small break of relief - where no one could see her - sure aided Atalanta in helping to hold out for the rest of each race.

Atalanta was aware that her moves were getting wilder and wilder. After the fourth race, she held one leg in the air and kept it pressed to her genitalia. In the middle of the sixth race, she had to bend down and clutch herself for a split second before continuing. Right before the seventh race began, she twisted her legs into a knot for a brief moment before untying them and starting the race.

Atalanta was sure people noticed these movements. Her father once asked her if she was okay. Atalanta lied that her legs were sore, but she insisted she was fine to continue.

At one point, Iasus pulled his daughter aside to remind her that if she lost a single race, she would have to get married and if the oracle was to be believed - which she should be, seeing as she was always right - then Atalanta would experience some sort o ‘downfall’ once married. Like Atalanta needs a reminder of what was at stake!

“I’m only reminding you of this, my daughter,” Iasus said softly. “Because I want you to take care of yourself. I have noticed some strange movements on your part. If you are feeling ill, tell me right now so I can cancel the rest of these races for today. We can always reschedule. The last thing I want is for you to get married and have this horrible prophecy come true.”

Iasus rested his hand on Atalanta’s shoulder. It was hard for Atalanta to believe that this was the same man who abandoned her as a baby. Long story short, Iasus wanted a son, so he left Atalanta on a mountain to die. Fortunately, Atalanta was raised by a family of bears, blah, blah, blah, she one day found her father, and now the two of them were on good terms. Iasus may not have been dad of the year, but he did care about Atalanta. (Minus when he tried to kill her, that is).

Atalanta knew she should tell her dad the truth. Her bladder was screaming at Atalanta to be upfront right then and there. But the tiny piece of Atalanta’s brain that was not underwater in a yellowed-down sea yet refused. Atalanta just couldn’t bring herself to mention how bad her need was. It wasn’t that she was embarrassed. Heck, Atalanta would gladly shout from the rooftops every time she was ready to have a bowel movement! Telling her father she had to hiss out some piss was no issue for her. But given the circumstances and how everyone expected Atalanta to be a strong heroine, she felt it her obligation to once again turn down a bathroom break.

What would her crewmates of the Argo say? Atalanta could hold her urine at bay longer than any man aboard that ship. It would be shameful if she could not contain her waters for a few more minutes. Besides, there were only three races left for the day. She would wrap them up and she would pee. And she would happily use a nearby bush to do her business. Atalanta was already planning out where she would relieve herself. No point in going back to the castle, she would pee right around the track. But where? Anywhere looked good. No, Atalanta had to focus. No pissing yet!

Atalanta started the third to final race of the day. After a count of ten, she took off. Atalanta’s belly was jiggling under her bladder like a barrel of chunky milk. Her bladder was hard to the touch and incredibly painful. With every step Atalanta took, she felt closer and closer to exploding all over the place. But she clenched her muscles tightly, forcing her sphincter to remain locked in place.

Atalanta managed to defeat yet another suitor and now had two left for the day. Each race was more excruciating than the last. Atalanta soared down the race track, charging as fast as she could possibly manage. Atalanta imagined that there was a chamber pot at the end of the track. That allowed her to zoom even faster than ever before. Atalanta destroyed yet another suitor. One left.

Only one race to go and Atalanta was ever more frantic for relief. She could hardly wait. Excitement flooded her like her urine would flood the grass. Atalanta would complete this final race and she would dive behind the nearest bush, not caring who saw. If anything, Atalanta wanted people to see, she wanted her suitors to acknowledge the fact that she wasn’t your ordinary woman. Atalanta could hold it like a champ, and she could urinate whenever she saw fit.

Atalanta’s golden waters had stretched her bladder walls to the max. She imagined her bladder so full that it turned bright red with a danger warning and her pee backed up into the ureters. Atalanta needed relief right away!

As she counted to ten for the final time of the day, her legs were constantly kicking behind her. Atalanta lifted a hand from the track to give her womanhood a nice, hard squeeze. Atalanta still refused to leak, but she felt the pressure skyrocket on her pussy. There was a pressure greater than the entire Mediterranean Sea resting on her vulva. It was so painful that Atalanta wanted to cry. She was sweating profusely. And it wasn't the exercise of the race nor the heat that was causing it. The sole activity of holding back this much fluid was causing Atalanta’s entire body to shut down. Even on the Argo she never held this much.

Atalanta thought of her drinking content with Pan and the wood nymphs. She thought of all the water she consumed just a few hours before, after her hunting session. This urination was going to happen soon and Atalanta could not wait to rid herself of this unwanted pressure!

Atalanta finished counting and took off. Her body was shaking and sweating. Atalanta was running much slower than before. She had to spend so much energy into holding back the flood, she found the activity of running to be extra tiring.

Atalanta completed the first half of the track all while dancing back and forth. Thank the gods this suitor she was currently racing was pretty slow himself. This was one of the more slow suitors Atalanta has raced thus far. But even the slowest suitor was much faster than a full-bladdered Atalanta. Atalanta started these races off by creaming her competition. Even with a bladder in a blazing hot, swollen to the size of a moon crater, state. After having raced many suitors already, however, Atalanta was shaking and just wanted to end this.

Atalanta tried to imagine that a chamber pot was at the end of the track, just as she did before. This little bit of motivation helped slightly. Atalanta was able to pick up speed. But the weight of her bladder was so strong now, that if Atalanta didn’t keep her legs crossed at all times, she was sure to lose a great deal of cargo. Atalanta had to keep herself twisted or else her bladder would force its way out past her whimpering sphincter. Atalanta could see it now… She runs along the track and an entire balloon falls out of her urethra and splatters open once hitting the ground. Urine would soak all of Arcadia.

Atalanta grit her teeth and shoved down those thoughts. Hobbling along, she pushed forward. The suitor was almost at the finish line. Atalanta badly wished she had asked her father for a break before when he asked. Iasus was right. If Atalanta got married, the prophecy of Delphi would be kicked into motion. Atalanta would suffer a great downfall due to marriage.

No! After all, she has been through with the Calydonian Boar, the golden fleece, the funeral games of Iolcus… Atalanta could not earn an L just because she was holding a tad too much urine in the tank.

Atalanta thought of her past romance, Meleager, the prince of Calydon. Atalanta wondered what Meleager would have to say about her current condition. Meleager had supported Atalanta when no one else would. When the rest of the Calydonian Boar hunters refused to allow Atalanta - a woman - to join the hunt, Meleager stuck up for her. When Meleager offered Atalanta the boar’s head as a trophy and his uncle took it away, Meleager defended her. (Granted, Meleager murdered his own uncle, but still…)

Her bladder was ready to shred past her sphincter just as her suitor was preparing the final few steps to cross the finish line. Atalanta kept the thoughts of Meleager in her mind, recalling every single time he defended her when his own men disrespected her and her gender. Atalanta would not go down like this!

She was a strong woman! Atalanta was the fastest marathoner in all of Greece. Her mentor, Chiron the centaur told her that himself.

Atalanta didn’t care who saw. She clutched her lady bits with both hands and galloped across the track. Atalanta’s knife sunk into the flesh of her suitor right before he crossed the finish line.

Iasus wiped sweat from his brow, relieved that his daughter didn’t have to get married and doom herself. That was close! But what Atalanta was about to do would be even closer.

Atalanta stashed her bloody knife in her robes and blasted across the field of grass, leaving a trail of flames behind her. Atalanta charged into the nearest brush, threw her toga upward, squatted down, spread her legs, and…

“GUUAHHHHHH!!!” Atalanta’s scream was the only thing more powerful than her hiss. A torrent worthy of Poseidon himself gushed from Atalanta’s womanhood. A river of shining gold fell from in between her thighs. The waterfall was as wide as a drachma and as loud as a raging rapid. Sweat dripped down Atalanta’s face and she panted. Urine rushed from her pee hole at super speeds. Atalanta knew there was no force on earth as swift as the river between her legs. (Not even her!)

Atalanta, feeling parched, reached into the folds of her robe and produced a canister of cold and fresh water. Atalanta’s teeth iced over as she began chugging down the liquid, completing the circuit between mouth and urethral opening. Refreshed, she put the canister away and sighed.

Atalanta was shielded behind her loving shrub, but the crowd of people who gathered to watch the races had their eyes fixed on her. Iasus also stared in awe at his gushing daughter. In an attempt to secure her privacy, Iasus began to rush everyone away. Iasus wasn’t the same man that abandoned Atalanta all those years ago, that’s for sure.

As the crowd cleared out, Atalanta was left alone in the bushes beyond\ the race track. Atalanta held her head back and gulped down some saliva. The relief was heavenly. Atalanta felt more satisfied than when she shot the Calydonian Boar in the eye. She was more at peace than when she belched and drank with the Argonauts.

A lake of pee was accumulating in the dirt. Atalanta had to go so badly that her stream was sloppy. She ended up splashing her feet and a stray dribble rolled down her legs. Atalanta is usually an expert at peeing outside. She grew up in the wilderness with bears after all! But Atalanta’s bladder was so bursting full of wee that her stream was incredibly messy. Atalanta was at the point where she would have gladly pissed all over herself. She just needed to void! And she finally, finally was.

This was the best feeling ever. She wouldn’t have to get married and she was draining all of that water and beer all in one go. Her bladder bulge began to shrink. Atalanta imagined the gods of Olympus and the glorious pisses they must take with their giant bladders.

Atalanta remained crouched behind the bushes for several long minutes. Even the gods would have been impressed with this pee. Just when Atalanta thought she was done, a new and even more powerful squirt emerged. Atalanta spent an embarrassingly long amount of time draining her aching urinary sack. After holding for over a day and drinking so much, Atalanta would have been more surprised if this pee was quick. It just shows how similar Atalanta’s bladder is to the gods.

Atalanta hissed into the earth for several more minutes. Who says humans can’t spend ten minutes spraying urine? It only takes a huge bladder captivity, many drinks, a long holding time, and most importantly, several footraces to stir things up.

Atalanta drip-dried herself until the last bits of pee fell from her damp pussy. She stood and fixed her toga. Atalanta wiped the sweat from her own brow and came out from behind the bush which was now soaked in glistening piss.

As Atalanta passed the track - now littered with bleeding deceased suitors - Atalanta could hardly wait for tomorrow when she would do all of this again. But hopefully, she would urinate before the races. Although, that magnificent feeling of the pressure-lowering internally was well worth every second of pain.

Next stop, Atalanta would journey to her bedroom to have some solo fun. That urination really got her going!

This next story was a suggestion from @warham1995

. This story is about the Norse goddesses Freya goddess of love, fertility, war, and magic, and Frigg the Queen of the Asgard gods, and the goddess of motherhood and marriage. Enjoy!

Freya kept her legs crossed under her dress. If only she thought to pee before venturing to Odin’s feast. Truth be told, Freya didn’t even need to go that badly. When she left her own palace, Sessrúmnir in the lands of Fólkvangr, Freya diffidently felt a small twinge in her bladder. But it was easily distractible. The urge was on the low side of things, so Freya just saddled up her chariot and went on her way to Odin’s with the intention of peeing later. But as she drove her chariot over the icy terrain, every bump in the road jolted her bladder, making the goddess of love closer and closer to losing control.

Freya was one of the most powerful Vanir gods, she would not piss herself like a weak mortal would! Freya crossed and uncrossed her legs repeatedly, the urge building with each bump her chariot passed.

The two large cats yanking Freya’s chariot barreled onward, none the wiser of their mistress’ predicament. Freya wanted to holler at them to be careful, but she was afraid her wise felines may catch onto her discomfort. So, the goddess of fertility kept her mouth shut and endured the rest of the agonizing ride in silence.

After many more bumps in the road, Freya’s cats drew to a slow stop. Freya’s chariot stood before a grand palace, twice the size of her own. Odin’s palace stood at the center of Asgard with the Bifrost bridge off to its side.

Freya parked her chariot in the lot and dismounted. Just standing up caused all of Freya’s internal pressure to zip down onto her womanhood. The goddess lifted a leg to his crotch and grit her teeth in agony. Freya noticed her cats staring at her. While her team of animals may not have been able to speak, they were as wise as Freya was and able to understand human situations.

Freya quickly regained her posture and sat her foot back on the ground. “My leg fell asleep,” the goddess of fertility lied. “It was a long ride from Fólkvangr.” That was a lie, and no one knew that better than Freya’s cats, the ones who pulled the chariot. In reality, Fólkvangr was so close, Freya could have just walked. The chariot ride was less than five minutes. But she didn’t know what else to say.

Freya’s cats exchanged looks, clearly skeptical about their mistress’ statement.

Freya brushed them off. They were just cats. They went in a litter box - granted a giant one - they knew nothing of human needs.

Swiping a hand at her feline friends as a way to tell them to drop it, Freya turned and hobbled up the massive staircase and into Odin, the all-father’s, grand hall.

“There’s my sis,” Freyr the Norse god of peace, fertility, rain, and sunshine approached Freya. Freyr had his arms outstretched, as he advanced towards Freya.

Freya gulped, knowing full well what was about to happen. The goddess of love readied herself to tell her brother she was in no mood for a hug. But if she did that, she would surely be questioned on why. And that was a question she couldn’t answer without humiliation.

So, Freya sucked it up and allowed her twin brother, Freyr to squeeze the life out of her. Freyr has always been a big hugger. He acted as if he hadn’t seen his twin in six years. Freyr grabbed Freya and lifted her off the ground. That movement alone forced the goddess’ bladder to cower. To worsen her situation, Freyr gave Freya the most intense squeeze of the goddess’ immortal life.

Freyr’s arms closed around Freya’s center, flattening her bulging bladder farther into her abdomen. Freya could feel her brother’s large arms pinch her bladder, making her ready to spurt. Freya could do nothing but bare down on her muscles and make a face of agony. Fortunately, with Freya’s head pointed the opposite direction, Freyr couldn’t see her look of torture.

“Freyr, put your sister down, you're hurting her,” said Njörd, god of the wind and the sea and the father to twins Freya and Freyr. Njörd came clambering over, using his oar as a walking stick.

“Huh?” Freyr looked ashamed, quickly setting his twin sister down. “Sorry, sis.”

“It’s fine, you weren’t hurting me,” Freya lied, crossing her leg casually in front of her.

“Good to see you, dear,” Njörd said, giving Freya a much more gentle hug than Freyr. While a second hug wasn’t ideal, it was still preferred to the bladder-bursting hug Freyr gave.

“Hi, daddy,” Freya kissed her father on the cheek.

“Ah, my girl, the most beautiful of the goddesses,” Njörd mused, tucking his daughter’s hair behind her ear.

Freya blushed. “Oh, daddy, stop…”

“You okay, sis,” Freyr asked, worry in his tone. “You look… Odd…” Freyr’s eyes looked his twin up and down, landing on her slightly gelatinous state.

No matter how hard she tried, the lovely Freya couldn’t stop bouncing. Her bladder was roaring louder than Gjallarhorn (the horn to signal Ragnarök). The goddess of love had to clutch her dress in her fists to keep from grabbing at her goddess parts. She could feel embarrassment flush her face.

“My legs are just sore from the long chariot drive over,” Freya lied.

“Isn’t your palace only a five-minute ride from here?” Freyr asked.

“What is with everyone and knowing the exact layout of Asgard?” Freya spat.

Freyr recoiled. “Sorry, sis, no need to get testy, I just…”

“I’m not testy!” Freya snapped, probably not helping her case. “I’m fine, okay, I’m just going to go and mingle.” Before her father or brother could say another word, Freya darted off between the long tables.

Freya could always use the bathroom, but as a goddess of war, she never liked the easy way out. As a Viking goddess, the way Freya saw it was this was war. Her bladder vs her willpower. No matter how much her bladder acted out, Freya would not urinate. To do so was a sign of weakness. And Freya - being the most attractive and strongest female deity - was by no means weak. Bathrooms were for the weak. Freya was a strong goddess and she could manage a little bit of water in her system.

Freya explored the halls as gods and goddesses filled in, all of them in conversation with one another. Freya took a soft breath, forcing her mind to relax. She was a strong goddess and she would not be bullied by her bladder. Freya removed her legs from one another and walked normally. She could feel her ball of urine swish around from side to side in her abdomen. But she ignored the constant signals being sent to her brain and continued walking along the halls of Odin, as though nothing was wrong at all.

Freya spotted Frigg who was carrying a large horn filled to the brim with mead. Frigg poured mead in the goblets laid out on the table. It was Frigg, the Queen of Asgard’s duty, to provide the mead at her husband, Odin’s banquets.

While watching golden liquid pour from horn to cup, an unbearable sloshing sound echoed off the metal glass and appeared to shake the grand hall. Freya, however, was the only one that appeared to feel the true power of the sound of alcohol. At least, that’s what she originally thought.

Freya then realized, even as she poured the drinks, Frigg was arching her lower legs repeatedly in a sort of dancing motion. This was a dance that Freya knew all too well. The bathroom dance!

Freya braced herself and approached the desperate queen.

“Frigg,” Freya called.

Frigg turned. The queen pushed the horn of mead to her crotch, using the horn to hold her genitalia in the sliest way possible. “Freya, hello,” Frigg said, still moving her legs in an ebb-and-flow pattern. “Is there something you need?”

Freya debated how to answer this. One particular word rang in her mind. “The bathroom,” she replied. The only reason Freya felt comfortable admitting this was due to the fact that Frigg also clearly needed to go.

“I feel you,” Frigg moaned, staring to the ceiling. “But there are many more drinks to pour. Do you know where the bathroom is or do you need me to direct you?”

“No thanks,” Freya said. “I don’t plan on using it either. I’m too tough to go and take a leak. I can easily hold it until the feast is over.”

“Me too,” Frigg nodded. “We are truly powerful goddesses, Freya. We can hold our piss until the feast has concluded. I just fear I may give in and go.”

‘What do you mean?”

“Like…” Frigg looked around to make sure no one could hear. Leaning in, she whispered, “Freya, between us goddesses, I urgently need to go. I haven't gone in a solid month and it is catching up to me fast. I fear my urge may get the better of me and I’ll be forced to leave the feast to urinate like some lesser goddess.”

Freya considered this. Her urge was also rapidly building. If the goddesses didn’t do something, they may succumb to the pressure of their heavy bladders and use the toilet. Neither goddess wanted this. As arguably the two most powerful female deities in the entire Norse pantheon, it would be pathetic for them to have to widdle before the feast ended in a few hours. But as their bladders filled and grew more and more uncomfortable, the goddesses knew very well they may fall to the temptation the restroom provided.

If only there was something… Or someone that could help us resist the urge, Freya thought to herself. And aloud to Frigg, she said, “I have an idea.”

Thor the thunder god sat with his feet up on the table, leaning back on the wooden bench. Thor’s head was turned back and he poured some mead poured by Frigg, Thor’s stepmom, down his all-powerful gullet.

Freya and Frigg approached the son of Odin. Thor let out a powerful belch and looked up as he saw the two goddesses walk towards him.

“Hey, Thor,” Freya said.

“Hi, Thor,” said Frigg.

“‘Supp, ladies,” Thor replied, taking a large gulp of mead. “How’s it going?”

“Pretty well, I suppose,” Freya replied. “We actually came to ask you for a favor.”

Licking his empty goblet, Thor slammed the metal on the table and sat up straight. “What can I do you for?” Thor lifted up his mighty hammer, Mjölnir and heaved it over his shoulder. The hammer crackled with electricity. “Need me to bash some heads for you?”

The goddesses looked at one another and then back to the temperamental thunder god. “Uh, no,” Frigg said simply.

“Actually, Thor,” Freya cleared her throat. “This is a tad bit awkward to share with you, but Frigg and I… Really need to use the bathroom.”

Thor’s face was a mix of emotions. But the two that stood out were confusion at why they were telling him this and disappointment that he didn’t need to bash heads. “Okay…” Thor said, not knowing what else to say.

“You see, Thor, Freya and I are two very powerful goddesses,” Frigg said. “We are strong and mighty, it would be mortifying to our power, if we urinated in such a short time frame. This feast is only a few hours. What goddesses would we be if we peed within that time.”

“Even if no one sees us go, we would never forgive ourselves for urinating before the feast is out,” Freya said. “But we fear the urge will get so strong that we will be forced to rush to the toilet.”

“So, we ask you, Thor,” Frigg batted her eyelashes at the thunder god.

“Please, oh, please, courageous Thor,” Freya smiled in her most captivating way. “Do not let us pee. No matter how much we need it, no matter how we beg, do not let us go.”

“We don’t care if you must tackle us on our way to the loo,” Frigg added. “Freya and I are too puissant to take a little tinkle like a small bladdered mortal. We refuse to piss until the feast is out and we ask you to see to it that we do not go.”

Thor frowned. “I don’t know,” he said. “We may be gods, but even we must pee from time to time. It’s nothing to be shameful of. If you want my advice, just go. No one will think less of you.”

The goddesses looked at one another once more.

Freya placed a gentle hand on Thor’s shoulders, crossing her legs under her. “Please, oh, strong Thor… If anyone can keep us from the toilet, it is you.”

“You are so big and strong, Thor,” Frigg took a seat on Thor’s lap, folding her shaking legs as she did so. Twirling Thor’s beard, Frigg then said, “Please keep us from urinating before the feast ends. We do not wish to soil our reputation as strong Viking goddesses, after all.”

Thor flinched, having two of the most attractive - if not the most attractive - Norse female deities crawling all over him. Thor may be a son of Odin, but he was only man.

“O… Okay, if you insist,” Thor replied. Then with much more confidence, “Don’t worry, ladies, you shall not leak a drop on my watch!”

“Thank you, oh powerful, Thor,” Freya whispered in the thunder god’s ear, and then both goddesses gave him a kiss on each cheek. With Freya on his left cheek and Frigg on his right, Thor turned as red as freshly spilled blood.

“We shall sit next to you,” Freya took a seat beside Thor. “That way, if either FrIgg or I try to make a run for the restroom, you can hold us down.”

Each goddess sat on either side of the still-blushing thunder god.

It wasn’t long until Odin started the feast.

Gods and goddesses alike took their seats while the all-father announced his gratitude to have all of his family and friends at his banquet, blah, blah, blah. Neither Frigg nor Freya could hear Odin too well over the increasing urgency their bladders were producing. Frigg stared down at the wooden table, her hands secured into the folds of her silky dress. Freya meanwhile kept her legs crossed as tight as possible and drummed her fingers on the table as a way to distract herself. Unlike Frigg, Freya kept her eyes on Odin and did her hardest to focus on his boring speech. As tiresome as Odin’s words were, they were a good way to distract her from her bladder. (If Odin’s speech was a little more rousing, maybe it would have helped. But as it was, Odin was so dull, Freya doubted any of the gods were paying attention).

After what felt like months of emotionless drag, Odin finally said in his dry tone, “Now, let us feast.”

The gorgeous Huldras served platters of bread, meat, and dairy. The divine gods happily dug into their meal.

Engaged in enjoyable conversation, it was slightly easier for the two goddesses to forget their bladder’s woes and have a grand time at the feast.

“So, Freya, how are your daughters doing?” Thor asked.

“Fine,” Freya replied. “As my daughter, Gersemi has many gentlemen callers, naturally. And Hnoss is making friends and breaking hearts. It is tough for all of us right now as my husband, Odr, is once again traveling the nine worlds on business.”

“That’s too bad,” Thor said, biting into a large piece of goat.

“On the bright side, when I cried, my tears brought to life a field of daisies,” Freya mentioned.

Thor lifted his refilled goblet - courtesy of Frigg. “Silver lining,” Thor said supportively.

“Yeah,” Freya ran her hands up and down her calf.

“You okay, Frigg?” Thor asked, turning to his right.

There sat the Queen of the Aesir gods. Frigg wasn’t touching her food. Instead, her eyes were fixated on her goblet of mead. Frigg watched as a series of bubbles rose to the surface and popped. The yellow alcohol seemed to be taunting Frigg. The goddess of marriage wanted to toss her goblet out the window. Just looking at the concoction filled Frigg’s urinary bladder with panic.

Frigg jumped to her feet, banging her knees on the underside of the table. Frigg opened her mouth, letting out a silent scream. Her bladder was fluttering against her sphincter, nearly forcing fluid through the muscle barrier.

“I’ll be right back,” Frigg croaked out, making to leave.

Thor reached out and grabbed the queen’s arm. “Oh no, you don’t,” Thor warned. “You asked me to keep you from the bathroom and that’s exactly as I plan to do.”

Frigg’s eyes clouded over. “I… I wasn’t going to use the bathroom…”

“Then where, pray tell, were you rushing off too?” Freya asked, taking a slow sip of mead. The goddess of fertility knew she would regret that single sip later, but it was worth it to look so cool and intimidating.

“I… Um…” Frigg turned pale.

“Sit,” Thor commanded.

“You’re too big to run to the bathroom,” Freya said while her toes tapped the air irritably. “How old are you?”

Frigg looked close to tears. She had her legs crossed and her hands twitched at her sides, wanting nothing more than to give her godly pussy a nice, long, slow, firm clutch.

“You can hold it, Frigg. You are a powerful goddess after all,” Thor reminded a reluctant Frigg.

“You’re right,” Frigg exhaled. “I’m the master of my bladder, I’m the master of my bladder…” With that, the goddess of motherhood miserably slunk back down in her seat, rocking around the bench in a desperate attempt to keep her sphincter shut.

“You don’t look too good, Frigg,” said a cold voice. Thor, Freya, and Frigg had yet to realize who was sitting across from them. The god’s head had been turning, talking to others in the hall. It wasn’t yet that the group realized sitting directly across from them was none other than Loki the god of mischief himself! “Are you all good?” Loki asked in a taunting tone.

“Buzz off, Loki,” Thor snapped. “I think I speak for all of us when I say, we are in no mood for you or your tricks.”

Loki furrowed his brow. “Thor, still salty over the whole Sif incident. She told me to cut off her hair.”

Thor slammed his fist on the table, causing a crater to form in the wood. “My wife’s hair was her best attribute! No one wanted her to lose it less than she! I am warning you, you are on thin ice trouble maker!”

“Thin ice? Oh no,” Loki said sarcastically, drawing circles on the ring of his goblet with his finger. “Good thing we don’t live in a frozen wasteland where ice is worthless.”

Thor’s jaw looked like it was being stretched by hawks.

Loki turned his attention from Thor to Frigg. “Have to pee?” Loki asked. Loki said this in a casual tone as though he was asking Frigg’s help on a math problem.

“A little,” the queen squirmed.

Loki just nodded and helped himself to a loaf of bread. Breaking the bread in half and dunking one half in goat cheese, Loki said, “Why not just go? Why sit there and have your thunder buddy tell you when you are and aren’t allowed to go?”

Frigg turned even redder than Thor. “Um, Freya and I don’t want to pee until the feast is over,” Frigg said truthfully. “We are kind of ashamed of having to go this bad. We don’t want our bladders to boss us around, you know…”

“I get that,” Loki chomped on his loaf. Mouth full of bread, the trickery god said, “It can be annoying having to pee so bad. You feel pressure on your pelvis and all you can think of is water sloshing around inside.” Both goddesses shuttered at his description. Loki turned to Freya. “You have to go too, Freya?”

Freya fired Frigg an irritated look, angry at her for telling Loki she also had to pee. “Just slightly,” Freya folded herself in half. “But my bladder is strong. I can easily hold for a few more days if I need to.”

Loki nodded. “I imagine so.” Finishing his bread, the god rose and said, “Well, seeing as you ladies can’t use the powder room, I mind as well keep the seat warm for you. Just hope my aim isn’t off.” Loki flashed them a mischievous wink and then made his way to the bathroom.

“Don’t listen to him,” Thor told Frigg and Freya. “Just don’t think about it and you’ll be okay.”

Frigg and Freya tried to do just that. But the more they attempted to distract themselves with the driest of thoughts, their subconscious always seemed to tilt back towards their bladders’ needs. The two full-bladdered goddesses managed to eat some of the meal, but Frigg in particular found it tough to get anything down. She felt like she was going to be sick.

The meal drew on without too much excitement. But that quickly changed when Thor spotted Loki whispering into Odin’s ear. “What’s that scoundrel up to now?” Thor bellowed.

Odin stared at Loki with his one good eye. Odin looked angry but also intrigued by whatever Loki was telling him. Odin then waved Loki off and he grabbed his goblet. Odin clinked fork to glass, grabbing the entire hall’s attention.

Loki retook his seat across from Thor, Freya, and Frigg.

“What did you do?” Thor scowled as soon as Loki was seated.

“Attention, attention, everyone,” Odin called while the talking ever so slowly declined. “It appears that we have a challenge here.” Odin fixed his eyes directly on Thor. Thor flinched in confusion. The rest of the gods and goddesses now gave Odin their full attention. As Viking gods, there was nothing this group loved more than a good old-fashioned challenge! “Frigg and Freya, please come up here,” Odin called.

The two goddesses froze in ice. It wasn’t Thor that Odin was looking at. He was looking at the two bursting Norse goddesses who Thor was sitting in between! Freya and Frigg glared at Loki. Thor looked ready to pound Loki into the nearest snow bank.

As much as they hated this, Freya and Frigg both knew that they couldn’t turn down a Valhallan challenge! They would be the laughingstocks of the gods. There was nothing more humiliating for a Norse god than to refuse to partake in a fun (and often brutal) challenge.

Even though they could barely stand, Frigg and Freya made their way down the rows of tables and up to the head table where Odin sat facing everyone. Normally Frigg sits with him and the three Norns, but Frigg already told her husband she would be sitting with Thor this evening.

Odin folded his arms across his chest. His body language suggested he was miffed, but he wore a jolly smile on his face. “Loki tells me that you two have challenged me to a mead drinking contest.”

The two goddesses nearly exploded on the spot. Frigg was hunched over, holding onto her knees, and Freya kept her legs double-twisted. Their bladders were full to the brim as was. No way in the nine worlds could they possibly handle alcohol right now! But they could feel all of the gods watching them intensely, eager to hear their rebuttal. Once again, Loki was bent on making everyone miserable. Freya and Frigg couldn’t refuse or they would seem like cowards. There was only one way to make it out of this situation with their dignity intact.

“Yes, Odin,” Freya gulped. “We… Mead drinking contest, yes…”

“Yeah,” Frigg uncomfortably rested a hand on her severely bloated stomach. Frigg felt fear rattle through her mind. As a goddess with three children, Frigg’s bladder isn’t what it used to be. And Frigg can safely say, she had to pee worse now than she ever did while pregnant! But Frigg is still a goddess. Even with her bladder in its current state, Frigg can contain twelve times more than the strongest bladdered mortal! The same goes for Freya who has had twin girls.

“Very well,” Odin rested his hands under his armpits. “It’s a bet. The Norns shall be the judges and this crowd shall be the witnesses. Whoever drinks more mead has to clean all of the toilets in Asgard for a decade. Deal?”

The two women trembled. That was a lot of toilets and a long time. Neither one felt too good about their present situation. But they were Norse goddesses! They could hold their waters a little longer while chugging mead. They couldn’t refuse anyway or seem like chickens. While neither Frigg nor Freya felt super confident, they knew they couldn’t turn this down.

They both looked at Thor for support. Thor - being the only one to know Frigg and Freya’s dire situation besides Loki - looked back and forth, not knowing what to do or how to help.

The two goddesses returned their attention to Odin and together they said, “Deal.”

Odin grinned, his twin crows flapping around him. “Very well. May the best drinker win.”

Three humongous kegs of mead were set out. Each god, Odin, Freya, and Frigg stood before each keg. Frigg had her legs moving up and down behind her again. Freya, meanwhile, crossed her legs and kept her hands buried in between them. Thankfully, the kegs were so huge, no one could see what the gods were doing behind them. Each keg had a very long and wide straw sticking out of them. The kegs were so massive, that only Thor could lift them. Thor looked skeptical to bring the kegs in, but when Odin threatened him, Thor did as told. Now, Frigg and Freya felt weeks upon weeks of old urine sting their bladder walls, and they stared at the fifty-liter kegs, one in front of each of them, they were expected to drink quickly.

The three Norns took their places on stools. Each Norn would keep track of how much each god drank. Urd was watching Freya, Skuld was keeping her eyes on Frigg, and Verdandi was observing Odin.

The crowd of eager gods and goddesses pounded their fists in the air, chanting for the contest to start. Giving into the demands of the gathered deities, Urd shouted, “Let the mead drinking contest commence!”

Odin wasted no time in slurping down his barrel. Odin’s lips were pulled as far apart as they would go. His gaping mouth rested on the massive metal straw. Mead sped through Odin’s drink, rushing from straw into his immortal form.

Freya swallowed down her bladder’s anxiety and placed her lips to the keg as well. Frigg hesitated for a moment. But when she noticed Odin was already a quarter of the way down, she knew she had to drink something! So, Frigg began sipping.

Freya was the first to understand the true measure of Loki’s evil plot. Freya instantly felt a pile of rocks smash her sphincter. The pain was so unbearable, Freya withdrew her head from the keg and let out a scream. Mead spilled from the opening of the straw and splattered Freya’s new dress. The goddess collapsed, grabbing hold of her keg for support. Freya’s legs were tied together, a hand fastened to her crotch, causing her dress to wrinkle. Freya’s eyes were so filled with tears, she felt like she was looking underwater. 

The pressure on her bladder went from uncomfortable to burning-inferno-of-agony-and-unimaginable-pressure. Freya had never had to pee so badly in her entire life. She could already feel droplets trying to escape. But she kept her muscles in place. The goddess of fertility wiggled around, she was a war goddess! She couldn’t stand up here and squirm like some mortal! But the pressure was so powerful, Freya felt like it was eating her from the inside out. What was in this mead!

Whatever it was, it appeared to only have an effect on Freya. Odin was nearing the halfway point and he looked totally fine. Freya fixed her eyes on Loki, but he was gone. Freya blinked away tears. She knew for a fact Loki added something to her drink to make her become this desperate so quickly.

All eyes were on Freya, concerned about her. Even Odin looked sidelong at the goddess of war, nervous as to her nearly falling.

Freya could barely speak. Her pelvis was on fire. Pressure charged her sphincter, making holding more difficult than teaching mortals rune magic. (As much as Freya loved mortals, they were challenging at times). But not nearly as challenging as holding back her already full bladder now mixed with super mead.

That’s when Frigg felt the effects. Frigg drank a lot less mead than Freya, so it wasn’t nearly as intense for her. Nevertheless, pressure turned Frigg’s bladder into a sailing ship in the middle of a storm. Frigg knew she was about to crash that ship (her sphincter) and piss all over the place. If Frigg didn’t have to pee before, now she could hardly think.

Frigg tumbled to the ground as well, hands in her genitals. Frigg smashed her head on the floorboards, her bum in the air. The goddess wiggled around, not caring who saw. She couldn’t bear this any longer!

Just when things couldn’t get any worse, there came a soft dripping sound from above Frigg and Freya’s heads. Drip… Drip… Drip… It was like a leaky faucet coming from inside the ceiling.

“What’s that?” Verdandi asked.

“Think it’s a leaky pipe or something,” Skuld suggested.

Through her tears, Freya forced herself to look up and she couldn’t believe what she saw. Far above her head, there was a woodpecker drilling its beak into a ceiling pipe. Little leaks dripped from the pipe and landed in a perfectly placed glass of water. But the thing that got Freya the most, was that the woodpecker in question had a crooked beak and a mane of well-kept blond hair. Blond hair… Crooked beak… Loki’s two main features were his crooked nose and his well-kept blond hair. Loki was the woodpecker and he was the one drilling into the pipe causing a leak.

Drip… Drip… Drip… poured the water into the half-filled glass.

Freya felt ready to pop. The pressure inside her belly hurt too much to even stand. The goddess of war just kept her toes crossed and her hands in her dress. Frigg, meanwhile, lay on the floor, moaning and crying.

Attention in the hall was removed from the drinking contest and placed onto Frigg and Freya’s suffering. Even Odin didn’t care more about this contest than his wife.

“Frigg, Freya, are you two okay?” Odin extended a hand to help his wife up. But Frigg knew she couldn’t move. If she did, she would burst wide open.

Freya’s teeth sawed at her lower lip. The goddess stood on one foot with the other wrapped around her leg. She leaned her entire weight against her keg of mead which she barely touched. Freya’s body involuntarily swayed back and forth. Her bladder screamed as it became inflamed with Loki’s dirty trick. Freya squeezed her necklace, Brísingamen, tightly, trying to do what little she could to diverge the torment away from her ferocious piss balloon.

Freya’s mind had abandoned her. She could barely concentrate. Freya wished to remind herself that she was an all-powerful war goddess and that she could win this battle with her bladder. But she knew it was untrue. Freya knew she would be kicking herself for this betrayal of her strength later, but she no longer cared about appearing strong. She needed to drain this horrible sensation right away!

“I… Need… Bathroom…” Freya made to leave, but she could hardly walk. She just fell back onto her keg again. Pulling herself up, Freya tried again. She managed to make it two measly steps when a cold voice said,

“Is that okay with you, Thor?” Loki was back in human form, sitting on top of a table, eyeing the god of the sky. “Only you can give them permission after all? Is it okay with you if Freya and Frigg use the restroom?”

Thor became baffled. The obvious answer was yes, they dearly needed it! But the two goddesses made Thor promise not to let them go. Thor looked between the two crumpling goddesses and Loki. “I…” Thor managed. “Well, I… Uh…”

This few second delay was all Loki needed for his sinister plot to come full circle.

Freya’s sphincter muscle had it. After restricting its flow for weeks on end now, and worse, adding extra labor to its struggle, Freya was the first to cave in. An all-powerful rush filled the hall as Freya’s sphincter contracted and her pee hole opened wider than a patient’s mouth at the dentist's. Freya’s brand-new golden dress was flooded with urine. The dress the dwarfs made Freya of pure gold grew a wet spot on the front. The wet patch expanded outwards and branched in all different directions. Warmth flooded Freya’s legs. She could feel waterfalls blast down her skin. The relief was exquisite! Freya didn’t care that she was pissing herself before all of the gods. She had never felt anything half as luxurious as releasing the pressure that caused her bladder to undergo so much hardship for so long.

Freya just rested a hand to her belly and breathed through her nose. She could feel a massive puddle forming below her. The puddle ran down the steps leading to the center table. The gods and goddesses all quickly placed their feet on their benches to avoid getting soaked in Freya’s flash flood.

Freya’s mind was as numb as if it had frostbite. The goddess of love didn’t care about a thing other than draining the intense pressure brought on by the heavy mead Loki tricked her into drinking. Freya’s urine stunk of alcohol, confirmed by the many scrunched-up noses of the audience. But Freya was just so happy to finally get this affliction over with, she cared not what happened after this.

“Oh, my, Freya!” Loki cried. “Are you wetting yourself?”

“Sure am, Loki! Sure am!” Freya shouted proudly. If living among the Aesir gods has taught Freya anything, sometimes confidence is the only thing needed to escape a dastardly experience.

Frigg whimpered, closing off her muscles as best she could. The added pressure to her system made Frigg’s whole body tighten. The powerful hissing coming from Freya’s crotch was enough to cause a single squirt to fly out of Frigg’s. The back of Frigg’s dress became damp. The blast was so powerful, it shot right through the fabric of her clothing and soaked the floor behind her.

Seeing this, Odin took a step back, bewildered. “Frigg… Dear…” He began.

“Stand back, hon,” Frigg whimpered, fighting as long as she could. “I’m gonna blow!!!”

And she did.

Frigg’s dress switched from white to gray in a matter of seconds. Urine blasted from behind Frigg, power soaking the wall behind her. Frigg continued lying on her face with her butt raised in the air as she wet herself entirely. Whatever wasn’t sopped up by the fabric of her clothes, came out through the dripping wet garment. Small urine streams dribbled from under her.

Unlike Freya - who was loving every moment of this - Frigg was screaming in pain. For the goddess of marriage, this was pure torture. Frigg’s stream was four times as powerful as Freya’s. Whereas Freya was able to control her flow (more or less) Frigg’s pent-up bladder blasted urine out of her pee tube at speed so fast, it burned badly. Frigg’s lower body was in pain as urine shot from her and drenched the entire front half of the hall.

“And now Frigg is peeing herself!” Loki slapped a hand to his chest. “My word, ladies! Do you have no control!”

Silence covered the great hall of Odin. The only noise heard was that of two all-powerful sprays of urine. Frigg sobbed the entire time. For the first part of the relief, Freya just had a pleasant smile on her face, not embarrassed whatsoever. But when the pressure decreased enough for the goddess of love to think straight again, the first thing Freya did was blush and stare down at the tsunami that was coming out of her. Freya could not believe that she, Freya, goddess of war itself, was wetting herself! She should have been able to hold it! Freya - just as she predicted - was furious with herself, but even more so at her bladder, and even more angry at Loki.

The tides continued to rise in the great hall. Two massive bladdered goddesses pissed their hearts away. Odin himself was now ankle-deep in urine. The Norns climbed onto a nearby table to avoid the flood.

When it was all over - two and a half hours later - the urine level in the great hall was so high, that all the gods had to kneel on top of the tables. Odin was brave enough to stand in the stuff, now knee-deep in his wife and Freya’s bladder-bursting bulk.

Both Freya and Frigg were soaked in their own pee. Frigg continued to stand on her hands and knees with urine up to her chest, making her white dress see-through and thus exposing her breasts to the gods. Freya, on the other hand, was standing knee deep - like Odin - in bubbling hot bladder broth.

The silence lasted even longer.

It was Idun (goddess of youth) that was the first to speak. Staying on her hands and knees, holding onto the side of the table, Idun peered down into the yellow swirling ocean covering every square inch of the main hall. “Whoa,” Idun said. “That’s a lot of pee.”

Frigg was still in tears, the salty droplets from her eyes splashed into the lake of pee, making the yellow surface ripple.

“Oh, honey, it’s okay,” Odin said softly, helping her to her feet despite both of them dripping in pee. “It’s okay… It… It happens… WHO’S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS!” Odin bellowed, his soft husband nature switching to that of a vengeful all-father in a matter of milliseconds. Then, Odin turned his attention to someone unexpected. “THOR!!!” Thor jumped so high, he was able to grab onto a ceiling light. “LOKI SAID YOU WERE TELLING MY WIFE AND FREYA WHEN THEY COULD USE THE FACILITIES!!!” Odin trumpeted. “EXPLAIN YOURSELF, THUNDER GOD!!!”

Still swinging from the light, Thor stammered, “I, uh, I, um, they, I, ah…”

“Don’t blame Thor,” Freya cut in. “Frigg and I got overconfident in our holding abilities. We felt embarrassed being two powerful goddesses that had to rush to the bathroom.”

“Well, there is nothing embarrassing about holding this much pee!” Ullr (the god of snow sports) said, standing on a vertical ski pole so he could avoid touching the urine as much as possible.

“Freya’s right,” Frigg told her husband, wiping tears from her eyes with her urine-coated fingertips. “We asked Thor not to let us pee. It was our doing. Don’t be mad at Thor.”

“Yeah, be mad at Loki!” Freya snouted, rounding on the trickster god. “Loki is the one that tricked you into challenging us to a mead drinking contest when he knew we were this desperate to pee. And he drilled at the pipes to make us have to go worse. And he switched Frigg and my mead for heavy stuff making us fill even faster.”

“LOOOOOOKKI!!!” Odin ragged.

“Time to fly!” Loki saluted the gods and then shapeshifted into a small horsefly. Loki took to the air and almost got away, but he was captured in between the fingers of Thor - who was still hanging from the ceiling light.

Thor jumped down to the table below him. Odin wadded through the swamp of pee, finally reaching the table Thor stood on. Odin’s face twisted with rage.

Loki giggled slyly. “Let’s all take a breath,” horse fly Loki suggested. “This whole experience was kinda funny. And you know, I think we all learned something. Like, don’t hold your pee. Or don’t believe everything you hear. Or, I don’t know, if a trickster god plays a prank, you should forgive him. Ooh, I like that last one!”

Odin’s eyes narrowed at the tiny fly in between Thor’s fingers.

“Loki, I expect this hall to be spotless,” Odin warned.

After draining all of the urine, Loki was now on his hands and knees, sponge in hand, bucket brimming with soapy water to his side, and to the trickery god’s discomfort, a bladder ready to burst held back only by crossed legs.

“How’s the bladder feeling, Loki?” Frigg teased.

“Gotta go, do you?” Freya called.

Loki grumbled some curses as he shimmied his weight across the still-damp floor, swabbing up any puddles of urine he came across. Taking a brief break to squeeze his cock, Loki couldn’t believe this terrible turn of events. Cleaning floors covered in urine while desperate to pee himself was Pain. Ful! He didn’t deserve this comeuppance!

“And after that,” Thor added. “You can clean every toilet in Asgard. That is your punishment for the next ten years.”

“Do a good job today, and we’ll let you pee,” Frigg said.

“Fail and you can hold all throughout the night,” Freya warned.

As Loki moaned about his wretched luck, Freya and Frigg high-fived.

I know artemis appeared in the first story already, but it would be really cool to see them again.

I could certainly do Artemis again at some point! She is, after all, one of my personal favorite Greek goddesses! That being said, I have written several more stories about gods from all different pantheons, so I haven't a clue when I would get around to doing another Artemis story. I'm not too focused on doing the gods I've already done a second time. But truth be told, I probably will at some point.

This next story is about Mars the Roman god of war. Naturally, this story is about male desperation. I normally write strictly female stuff as I am a straight male, but I also know there are plenty of heterosexual women/homosexual men on this site. So, this story is for you guys! Regarding Mars, he is associated with the Greek Ares, however, these two gods were polar opposites. While Ares was a hot-tempered, childish, and frankly an annoying character, Mars was much more tactical, wise, and strong. For the most part, I'm not going to write about the Roman gods because the Greek and Roman gods are basically the same thing. But Mars and Ares are so different, if I'm going to write about anyone, Mars is my best bet!

Here goes, enjoy!

Mars zipped through the field of wheat. The stocks brushed against his shin, twisting as if trying to give the god of war a great big hug. Mars kept two hands, one placed over the other, piled on top of his crotch. Mars squeezed his member, feeling his bulging bladder spinning in circles, having a full-on panic attack. His blasted bladder was bursting at the seams with wine and nectar and whatever else the Roman god had had to drink over the past few weeks.

His armor rattled as he rushed through the crops. He could feel his armor squeeze his bladder like the hand of a giant squishing a bug. Mars could feel countless drops of urine splash up and down. He could feel the waves rolling around inside, crashing into his bladder walls, bearing down on his strained sphincter. Mars hasn’t been this urgent to piss in a long time.

Mars cursed himself, knowing this was his fault.

Why had he had so much wine at last night’s banquet? Mars had already been celebrating the Romans' victory over their enemies even before they won the battle. Just as Mars had predicted, they won the war and all of the celebratory wine he had in advance did not go to waste. But now it was bursting to come out.

On top of this, Mars had pushed off using the powder room for far longer than he should have. He had felt his first urge to alleviate himself nearly two weeks ago. But he was too busy strategizing tactics for this battle that he simply didn’t have time for relief. All Mars did those two weeks was plan, eat, drink, sleep, and feel his bladder fill. He didn’t have time for anything. Not even a micturition break.

Mars planned on peeing last night. That way, he would be able to arrive on the battlefield today with a nice and refreshed empty urinary bladder. But alas, Mars had so much to drink at the feast, he had passed out long before getting a chance to step away to the godly lavatory. Fortunately, Mars is a god, so while alcohol affects him as it does all other living beings, his alcohol tolerance is much higher than a mortal’s. In other words, Mars was able to sleep off the effects, with no hangover required.

The bad news was that he slept too long. When he awoke, the sun was already rising. As badly as he needed one, he had no time to spare on a restroom visit, rather, he geared up in armor and weapons and sped towards the battlefield.

Mars verily hoped that his army of Romans hadn’t noticed his discomfort. While the god was forced to stand on one leg - the other pressed into his pelvis - or grapple at his nethers for quick periods, he didn’t think the Roman legion had noticed his truly awful situation.

The worst part was the actual battle. Having to wield a sword on a bladder full to the brim was far less than ideal. The constant jumping and moving and dodging of blades did not help the god’s situation. Every time Mars was forced to make a swift movement, he felt a surge of pressure shimmy up his penis shaft and take over his entire lower body.

On one particularly dangerous movement, when Mars was forced to dip down to the dirt and rise again, all while swinging his sword in an arch, a short yet powerful blast of piss fired from his urine hole and soaked the inside of his toga. Thankfully, due to his armor, no one could see the hidden wet spot that was sure to stain the toga he wore underneath.

Even now as Mars took flight from his celebratory Roman army, he could feel his bladder sway to and fro inside his godly ribs. Mars’ armor did a swell job of hiding his bladder bump which was surely the size of a three-month pregnant woman.

Mars’ bladder continued to give him torment as the god stomped through the fields, in desperate need of a release.

Mars could always whip it out and fertilize the crops. But he didn’t think Ceres (Roman goddess of agriculture) would like that very much. Besides, Mars was also a god of fertility. It was one of his more minor roles in the Roman pantheon, but one of his roles, nonetheless. Mars couldn’t shower his urine over the legions fields. What kind of animal would he have to be to do such a disgraceful act? If Mars could conquer entire armies single-handedly, he surely could hold his flood a tad longer.

Mars had led the Roman people to victory on numerous occasions. The god was very pleased with the glorious job he did of commanding such a fine army. He wished he could have stuck around to celebrate with his men. But at this very instant, the god of war knew if he did not find a place to drop his urine ball, he would be in serious trouble.

Mars’ kidneys were still producing urine, filtering whatever of his late-night wine had yet to be processed. The Roman god had a bladder made of steel. But there was only so much his piss sack could do to contain the waters of much-delayed urination. His bladder stung and his sphincter bellowed curses at the god. Mars drew his feet faster still, in a very despairing state of mind. Mars knew he only had so much time to pee, but there was no place to go out here. He was only a few miles from the spot where the battle took place. It wasn’t like the Romans built bathroom chambers on the site of their wars. When you are fighting in a life or death battle - as Mars is well aware of - you cannot just halt and urinate as you see fit. It isn’t a game of hide-and-seek where you can call a time-out just because someone needs to make potty. It’s kill or be killed, a fight for life and for the rights of Romans everywhere!

Mars finally burst from the field of wheat. The Roman god weighed his options. He could teleport to Olympus and piss there. But teleporting may add extra tension to his groin, thus reducing his limited time even more. Come to think of it, Mount Etna wasn’t far. That would take even less strength to travel through teleportation. Mars’ brother, Vulcan (god of volcanos and blacksmiths), owned a forge on the mountain. Vulcan was certain to allow his brother access to his restroom. But was Mount Etna close enough that Mars would be able to hang on to his full pocket of piss through the teleportation process? He decided not to risk it. Showing up at Vulcan’s doorstep in soaked and dripping armor would be the most humiliating experience in the god of war’s entire existence.

Not to mention, it would be highly rude for Mars to just abandon his army right after they won a battle. Mars may have taken off, but he had every intention of returning to them as soon as his business was taken care of and celebrating with his army.

The heavy feeling in Mars’ abdomen was driving him loopier than a flock of vultures above a freshly deceased carcass.

Mars felt fury rising in his chest. The god of war was prepared to smash entire mountains, determined to find a toilet! Mars’ whole body burned with wrath.

Mars did not like this feeling and he desired to get rid of it. He was enraged that he could not. Mars’ rage was put into check when he heard familiar voices calling his name.

“Mars! Mars!” cried Virtus the Roman goddess of courage and military strength.

“Mars!” shouted Honos the god of honor.

“Mars, where are you?” trumped Virtus, hand cupped to her lips as a make-shift megaphone.

Mars saw Virtus and Honos’ heads sticking a few feet from the fields of crops. Using every swear word he knew, Mars gave his shaking penis the firmest squeeze of them all. He then composed himself and faced his two lieutenants of battle. Virtus and Honos followed Mars around and assisted him in every battle he fought in. Alongside his twin, Bellona, these two gods were Mars’ most trustworthy companions.

Honos was the first to spot Mars. The two gods emerged from the rows of wheat and stepped up to Mars. It took all of the war god’s might not to shift around. He pressed his legs as tight as they would go and resisted the urge to grasp his manhood. His poor organ was screaming in pain, but the war god refused to hold it. Not while Virtus and Honos were here anyway.

“Mars, you wandered off,” Virtus said in a tone that told Mars she had no idea she was speaking an obvious fact.

“Yes,” Mars squinted down at the two smaller deities. His knees were pressed into one another. Mars could feel the pressure build inside. Simply by not holding himself, Mars felt more pressure than ever before. He begged for these two to leave him in peace.

“I believe she means, why did you wander off?” Honos clarified.

Mars felt his face go as warm as his bladder. Pushing the desperation down, Mars managed, “I just need a moment to collect my thoughts.”

“What thoughts?” Virtus asked. “We won the war! That’s a good thing… Correct?”

“Of course it is,” Mars scowled. While having a conversation with these two may go in circles from time to time, Mars never found it as painful as he did now.

“Look, I just need some alone time,” Mars instructed. “Go back and inform the others that I shall be back within the hour.” Mars hoped that was true. But with his bladder as rock hard as it was now, he doubted he would finish this piss before the century was up. “On second thought,” Mars shuffled his legs upon feeling his bladder pang in his belly. “Tell the legion to return to base and I shall meet them there. We shall celebrate tonight, I promise. But as of now, I need a moment…” Mars readied his lips to add that he needed a loooong moment. But he figured he got the point across.

Apparently, he didn’t.

Virtus asked confused, “Why, Mars? Why do you wish to be alone? We just had a grand victory! We should celebrate now! If nothing else, Honos and I should accompany you wherever you are going. Why not have us join you?”

Mars’ head filled with curses at Virtus. But he refused to say them aloud. For the goddess of military strength, Virtus’ overly friendly persona always astounded Mars.

“Please, Virtus, I wish to be alone,” Mars’ knees stuck together like honey. His voice was far more gravely than it had been a moment before. But Mars could no longer hold back his irritability. The pressure in his bladder was sending his nerves into a spurt of anger.

“But why?” Virtus exclaimed. “After such a long battle, you should wish us to…”

“Leave me alone, Virtus,” Mars growled, unable to stop himself.

Virtus was taken aback by this. Virtus may be a boss at controlling a military’s strength, but she has very thin skin. The smallest insult can upset her. And now, she looked close to tears.

Mars’ face dribbled with sweat. Guilt caught up to him. Mars looked to Honos for help. The god of honor just shrugged, not knowing what to do himself. Mars remembered his darling girlfriend, Venus (goddess of love and beauty). Venus once sat Mars down on her lap. Twiddling with his long curly black beard, Venus told her lover gently that he had to learn to control his temper. Easy for her to say. As the goddess of beauty, no matter how many times Venus loses her cool, she can just flash people her smile and or boobs and they instantly forget they were ever mad. Mars, on the other hand, didn’t have a good smile nor boobs to flash.

Heaving a sigh, “Virtus, I’m so sorry,” Mars moaned, feeling his penis quake with urgency. “I just really have to use the restroom, okay? I just want to be alone to pee.”

The goddess of military strength wiped a tear river from her cheek. “Why not just say so? We would have given you privacy.”

“It’s embarrassing,” Mars said, standing on one leg as his opposite leg twirled around his first. “I’m the god of war. I am the second strongest of the Roman gods, only followed by Jupiter himself! I led the Roman armies into battle on a daily basis. We always win with my leadership. The blood-red planet in the sky is named after me. The first month of the year is named after me.” (The month of March was the first month back in these times). “There is a feast in my honor at the beginning of the calendar year. I am a truly powerful and beloved deity,” Mars wailed. “And here I am on the brink of wetting myself… Besides, Bellona would tease me indefinitely if she found out.”

Virtus forced a smile. “I get it,” she said. “I’m cranky when I have to go as well. Nothing to be ashamed of. Just because you're powerful doesn’t mean you don’t have the same needs as everyone else.” Virtus playfully slapped Mars on the back. “Go pee. We’ll just tell everyone you had to return to Olympus immediately or something.”

Mars was overcome with gratitude. “Thank you, Virtus,” he exclaimed. “You two, Honos!”

Honos gave Mars a salute and said, “And as far as Bellona goes, even she has to pee! She has nothing to taunt you about, lord Mars.” Honos then walked off with Virtus at his heels. The two minor Roman gods vanished behind the thicket of wheat stocks.

As soon as Virtus and Honos were gone, Mars nearly jumped from his skin. Without his consent, a sharp jet fired from his penis, resoaking the front of his toga. Mars’ chunky fingers flew to his lips. Mars could feel the individual hairs of his long curly beard. It was comforting in a time of crisis. Mars the mighty Roman god of War had leaked twice at this point. And he feared that this next leak would be his last.

Mars turned and rushed off in the opposite direction of Virtus and Honos.

No bathroom in sight, the Roman god would have to make due. Mars stood at the edge of a tall cliff. The cliff looked down into a valley. Far in the distance, Mars spotted a Roman settlement. But for the most part, this valley was simply nature. There were tall mountains and a flowing river at the bottom of the canyon. The sky was a nice dark color, the way Mars preferred it. Despite being two hundred feet below him, the running water of the creek made Mars’ dance become much more desperate.

The war god struggled to remove his armor. With a bladder seconds from popping, Mars’ massive fingers fumbled over the straps. It didn’t help that they were the size of hot dogs. Mars had to take a break to strangle his penis with all his strength. Yanking his penis left and right, Mars shouted angry curses at his disobedient pecker.

Mars imagined his sphincter being as strong as his shield. Mars thought deeply of the famous Shield of Mars which was stored in the Roman Forum. The priests of the Forum kept his shield protected. It was the most powerful shield in the land. Nothing could even pierce it. That is my sphincter, that is my sphincter, Mars thought to himself as he reattempted to remove his armor. My sphincter is strong like my shield. It shall not let a drop pass.

Sweating and stomping his foot, Mars finally loosened the last strap and allowed his gear to tumble to the ground in a cloud of dust.

In a flash of final desperation, Mars lifted his toga, allowing his penis to flop in the springtime air, dangling below his waist, pointing its agony down at the valley far below. Standing on the cliffside, a look of bliss washed over the war god’s face. An explosion of urine shot from the head of his penis. Mars whistled out a satisfied breath. Clear liquid shimmered in the early evening sun. The piss exited Mars’ body in a pleasant rush. Mars had never felt so much peace as he did then.

Mars just stood there, holding his toga up with both hands, as his body willingly caved into the vast amount of pressure. Mars didn’t even hold his junk. He just allowed his penis to point downwards and spray the valley below. Mars’ bladder drained in a single stream. It ran through his shaft and out of the urethral opening, covering the landscape in godly water.

Mars closed his eyes and smiled. He just stood there and allowed his thoughts to go wherever they liked. The pressure dropped and his penis peed.

Between the victory of battle and this tremendous urination, Mars certainly was feeling horny. He would give it to Venus good tonight!

Mars just stood at the cliff’s edge. While his penis hung low and fired strong in a state of barefaced ecstasy, Mars thought of all the wonderful things in his immortal life. The glory he brought to Rome. The Romans viewed him as a glorious god (much different from how they viewed his Greek counterpart, Ares, who was a coward and a hotheaded wimp). There was of course the birth of Mars’ twin sons, Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome who were raised by wolves. There was his wonderful love life with Venus and all the times he and Bellona squared off in fake fights. (To which they were perfectly tied with who won). Mars had too many good things in his life to count. That - as well as his wonderful beard - makes him as far apart as his Greek counterpart, Ares, as day is different from night.

Mars stood on the cliff and peed and peed and peed and peed some more. His manly god’s bladder would take a very long time to run dry. Mars pulled off his toga so he was utterly naked. His eight-pack was exposed to the land as well as his majestic urinating cock. Now nude, Mars passed the time by cleaning the blood from his sword with a cloth. Mars assumed this would take a while since there was a lot of blood on his blade. And while, yes, cleaning such a sword took a long while, Mars’ bladder jet was still as strong as ever. Mars clapped his hips in a state of boredom. He conjured up a brush and began to style his beard just the way Venus liked. 

Knowing Venus, she was already prepared to make love tonight - especially after hearing of the successful battle - but an extra layer of sexiness never hurt. Even long after his beard was properly styled (a process that took longer than the founding of Rome), Mars’ penis was still squirting its essence down the gorge. Mars continued to wait. In a last-ditch effort to make the time go by faster, Mars had a mental argument with his rival, Minerva (goddess of wisdom). The two gods fought in Mars’ brain, having a heated discussion over whose tactics were better. Mars won the imaginary debate, naturally.

Mars let out a long-winded sigh. This glorious piss had once been phenomenal. But at this point, it was just annoying.

Mars’ penis continued to fire, with no end in sight. Mars attempted to bare down, making his member spray a stream thrice its current power. But after several minutes of relentless shoving, Mars quickly realized he was hardly making a dent in his bladder’s load. The war god promised himself then and there that he would never hold off pissing again. The longer the gods and goddesses held, the longer their eventual urinations.

Mars continued to stand there until the sun touched the horizon. Mars’ stream dribbled to a stop. Excitement rattled the god of war’s mind. But his stream just restarted and Mars huffed out his frustration. Nearing two hours of an endless stream and he still wasn’t done! Mars knew he had a bladder like a steel trap, but this was too much! How was it physically possible - even for a god - to hold this much without exploding? After seeing all he had contained, Mars felt less disgraceful about those earlier leaks. The sun was just visible by the time Mars’ stream stopped fully.

In the dark, Mars took his penis in his hand. (He had been peeing without any hands at this point). Mars gave his fellow a good shake, watching the final few drops of nectar fly off his strong and hefty manhood and tumble down into the valley below.

Placing his toga back on and gathering his discarded armor, Mars noticed something. Peering over the edge of his cliff, Mars realized, his urine stream was sweeping over the floor of the valley and running straight into the Roman settlement. It was an entire landslide of golden liquid flowing into the Roman town.

Mars turned as red as the planet named in his honor. But the relief felt too good to care. Mars just whistled casually and walked away from the scene of the crime, leaving the Romans to figure out why yellow water, the scent of wine, was pouring into their streets.

I also did a story about Maui the trickster god in the Hawaiian myths. Would you like to see me post his story next?

*046*2023-05-18 17:57

This next story is about Psyche the Greek goddess of the human soul. Let the record state that - unlike in my story - in actual Greek tradition, Hades never assigned Psyche to give tours of the Underworld, that is just a job I envision her having. As the goddess of the human soul, I could see Psyche greeting new arrivals to the Underworld.

Psyche’s legs remained as close together as the coffins of two lovers. Her knees twitched and her arms rested across her chest. Psyche attempted to remain still, but was finding it increasingly difficult as her bladder swelled to maximum captivity. The goddess of the soul knocked her knees together and swayed on her bare feet. If only she had thought to pee yesterday. That’s when her urge started getting bad. Psyche should have known something was wrong when she found that her bladder was so uncomfortable, she couldn’t sleep. But she didn’t feel like getting out of bed. Now she was tired and aching full. She also hadn't had anything to drink all day because of her urge.

Psyche was still learning how to be a goddess. It wasn’t easy being born mortal and becoming an all-powerful immortal later in life. It was worth it of course. But these things took some time to get used to.

Psyche spotted a dark boat rowing up to the shore of the River Styx. Charon the ferryman paddled across the dark waters with a single oar. Standing and sitting all around the ferryman were a dozen or so souls venturing to the underworld. Watching the oily waters churn and shift around the oar and the boat made Psyche feel as if someone was taking a boat ride across her bladder’s surface.

Once Charon came to a stop, the souls piled off of the boat.

“Thank you, Charon,” Psyche said.

The ferryman just nodded under his dark hood and began paddling back towards the opposite bank of the Styx.

“Hello, everyone,” Psyche said. The souls were busy chattering amongst themselves. Their voices sounded like wind chimes getting crushed with rocks. “My name is Psyche and I am the goddess of the soul.” The chatter slowly came to an end and Psyche just continued speaking. “I am excited to show you all around your new home of the underworld! I have not been here long, so forgive me if I am a little bit shaky at this…” As she said the word, ‘shaky’, the goddess could feel her bladder buzz against her pelvis floor. “C… Come with me…” Psyche’s voice trembled.

Psyche had to walk carefully, keeping her legs together. The goddess of the soul was truly amazed at her new godly form. She has been a goddess for a few months now and her new godly body never ceased to amaze her. Psyche has not peed in nearly a week. If any mortal tried that, they would have literally blown to pieces and died. Yet, here Psyche was. Holding her pee for almost eight days now. One day, Psyche wanted to test herself and see how long she could really hold for curiosity's sake. Of course, it made Psyche’s new job more difficult to give tours with a full bladder. But Hades gave her weekends off. Maybe if Psyche carefully planned it, she could hold her piss during the week and blow up during the weekend. It was Friday and a long weekend was coming up. If Psyche could just hold the rest of today, maybe she could learn more about her godly body over the long weekend.

Psyche showed the group the Judgment Pavillion where souls of the dead were judged on how they lived their lives. There was Cerberus the three-headed hound that guarded the gates to the underworld. Psyche explained how the underworld was divided into three main sections. The Fields of Elysium for the ones pure of heart who would be rewarded in the afterlife. The Fields of Asphodel were for those who lived a mediocre existence and would be forced to stand around doing nothing for the rest of eternity. And the Fields of Punishment where those who lived a rotten life were punished for their sins.

Psyche mentioned some of the noteworthy villains to wander down here. There was Sisyphus who cheated death twice. So he was forced to push a boulder up a hill for the rest of the time. There was Tantalus who fed his own son to the gods and as punishment was never allowed food or drink again.

Psyche warned the group to stay away from the cave entrance leading down to Tartarus. Tartarus is so dangerous, that the gods didn’t even allow the worst mortals to go down there. They couldn’t handle it. Tartarus was reserved solely for the Titans, monsters, giants, or any of the gods’ most powerful enemies.

Psyche also said that if the souls needed anything, they could visit Hades’ palace. Psyche also told the mortals where to find her cave. The souls thanked her and began to form a lion at the Judgment Pavilion so they could learn where they belonged in the land of the deceased.

The first tour of the day was done! Now only… Several more… Psyche knew she was immortal now… But her bladder seriously felt like it was going to burst before the day was out.

Psyche gave tour after tour. Countless undead faces passed by the Judgment Pavilion. Over the past few months, Psyche noticed a pattern. Some souls left the Judgment Pavilion dancing and cheering. Some had to be dragged against their will by guards all while kicking and screaming of how they were cheated. And others left the Judgment Table looking rather skeptical, but also relieved at the same time. It was quite easy to tell who was assigned where.

Psyche managed to forget about her bladder for some time. Every now and then she would get an incredible urge and she would be forced to stick a hand up her toga and squeeze herself at the surge of her urgency… Her vulva. But for the most part, the goddess of the soul was able to carry on her day.

The day finally ended with the final tour and Charon shut down his boat rides until tomorrow, leaving lots of disappointed souls on the other side of the Styx. Psyche felt sorry for them, but just like her bladder, Charon’s boat was only so big.

After the rest of the souls went on their way to the Judgment Pavilion, Psyche took this as her opportunity to return to her cave. Psyche lived on the far end of the underworld. She could just teleport and arrive there in a finger snap. But she enjoyed walking through the underworld. She had to pass through the Fields of Asphodel and she knew the poor souls there appreciated her company. It was the only company they had, really. Besides each other that is. Plus, based on what Psyche has heard from her fellow gods - she loved calling them that now - teleporting with a full bladder added tons of extra pressure to it making the already feeling of discomfort skyrocketed.

Psyche wandered down the plains of Asphodel, waving to the bored souls she passed by. Psyche had to stop several times to grab herself. Many souls asked her if she was okay. The goddess of souls fibbed that she was and went on her way.

At long last, Psyche approached her cave. She ventured inside and found her small cave which contained her bed and chests. In the back of her cave, there was a giant graveyard that represented each and every soul in the land of the dead. Psyche plopped on her bed and began to debate what to do next. She wanted to pee. How she wanted to pee! But Psyche was still (no pun intended) dying to know how much her newly acquired goddess bladder could hold. Psyche had always been a curious girl. Not as curious as Pandora… But curious nonetheless. It was that curiosity that killed Psyche in the first place!

She recalled the day Aphrodite forced Psyche to prove her love for Aphrodite’s son, Eros, and do many challenges. Gather grain seeds, get water from on top of a waterfall… But the hardest task of them all had been to bring Persephone a box of make-up. Psyche looked inside and bam! The godly makeup killed her. Fortunately, though, Eros asked Hades to revive his love, and Hades - a sucker for a love story - agreed. That is why Psyche joined Hades in the first place. To thank him for bringing her back to life so Eros could turn her into his immortal bride.

But back to her bladder, Psyche could feel immense pressure inside her pelvis and it only continued to increase. Psyche’s whole lower body was cramping up from the effort to contain her waters. Psyche reached into a chest and produced a fresh bottle of nectar. Psyche had only started drinking nectar after she became a goddess - if mortals drink this stuff, it will kill them - and Psyche loved it! Nectar was without a doubt her new favorite drink and ambrosia her new favorite food.

Psyche held the cool bottle of yellow liquid in her palms. She did find it awfully strange that nectar looked so much like urine. Psyche wondered why someone would invent nectar to look this way. Psyche held her head back and began gulping down the yellow drink. On the third or fourth swallow, Psyche could feel the pressure rise even higher. It got so bad, that one of Psyche’s hands abandoned the drink and held her privates instead.

Soon the bottle was gone and Psyche could feel her urge at an all-time high. Psyche also noticed her bladder had grown so far out, it was pulling her toga outwards. Psyche’s bladder felt rock hard. It was kind of satisfying to watch it grow and expand. This whole situation was satisfying. Psyche had never felt this way before. It was just some week-old urine. She should empty it. But Psyche found that she wanted to let her piss sit there. At least for now. She also found that her motivation for this decision was no longer simply ‘see how much I can hold’. Psyche kind of enjoyed this full feeling. Her insides were so toasty like cuddling under a blanket on a cold winter night with your romantic partner. Psyche had never felt like this before. In all of her years as a human, she had never enjoyed holding her pee like this. Was being a goddess that much different?

Before Psyche could come to terms with her thoughts, there was a knock on the cave wall.

“May I enter?” Hades called, standing in the cave entrance. Hades’ voice was slow and gloomy like he had lived his entire life without happiness.

“Yes, my lord,” Psyche quickly jumped from her seating position to greet her new boss. As soon as she stood, however, as quick as a blink, Psyche could feel the pressure migrate from her abdomen all the way down to her vulva. She felt as if a discus was pressing down on her lady parts. The sensation made her droll.

“I just wanted to thank you for all your hard work,” Hades leaned against the wall. “You have adjusted quite nicely. Even Charon says you are handling your new position well.”

“Charon? I didn’t know that guy talked,” Psyche joked.

“Yes, well, at any rate, thank you,” Hades said.

“I thank you for taking a chance on me and bringing me back to life,” Psyche said. “If it wasn’t for you my lord, Eros and I never would have married and his mom probably would never have accepted me.”

“Yes, well, I believe Pan the lord of the wild played a role in convincing your mother-in-law of your fine characteristics,” Hades pointed out. Psyche remained how the satyr god had comforted her when she was sad about her and Eros’ breakup. He even went out of his way to convince Demeter and Zeus to help Psyche in Aphrodite’s challenges.

“I owe a lot to you and lord Pan,” Psyche smiled warmly.

Hades was silent. But Psyche could tell he was fond of her statement. His eyes landed on Psyche’s bulge. Psyche could see the lord of the dead’s mind move from thought to thought. “Are you are Eros expecting already?” Hades asked in shock. Hades’ shock was justified given that Psyche and Eros had been married for three months at this point. And when you are an immortal god, there is no rush to start a family.

Psyche realized far too late that as she talked with Hades, she was rubbing her hand over her bladder the exact same way a mother would do to an unborn child.

“Of sorts,” Psyche replied with a grin. “But it’s not his. Actually, it is just mine.”

Hades was taken aback by this comment. Psyche smiled. Hades blinked like he misheard.

“But when Eros and I do have kids, I like the name Hedone. I think it would make a rather nice girl name,” Psyche stated. “My lord, I was wondering… Do you get to choose what your child becomes the god of? Like, did you choose for your kids?”

“No, but you can guide them down a certain path. In the end, it is their decision,” Hades explained.

Psyche replied to this, “I would like my child to be the god or goddess of physical joy. I think that’s appropriate.” Psyche addressed the final comment down at her bladder.

“Well, I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work again,” Hades said. “See you on Tuesday.” Hades gave one last look at Psyche’s giant bulge.

The poor god was probably concerned about why Psyche chose to have a child all alone when she had a husband who she was in a good relationship with. Hera had Hephestus all by herself. But Hera and Zeus’ relationship was the definition of toxic.

Once Hades was gone, Psyche sat back down on her bed and cracked open another nectar.

Eros had sent Hermes to the underworld to inform Psyche he was working late tonight but he would meet her in the underworld in the morning. Psyche hated when Eros worked late, but she knew the god of love was busy. Besides, that would give Psyche some extra time to play.

Psyche briefly debated masturbating but eventually decided against it. For she knew if she laid a single finger on any part of her vulva, she would burst in seconds. And she wanted to hold in her flood for as long as physically possible.

Psyche still refused to empty. She lay down in bed. Her hands stayed firm against her panging pee hole. Her sore bladder brushed up against the bed and added pascals of pressure. Try as she might, Psyche could not sleep like this. Her bladder was way too full. The goddess of souls could barely turn over without rupturing. Psyche still wanted to see how long she could hold at her max, sure. But she also loved this feeling. Psyche wished she could keep it in forever. Oh, why did she have to empty it at all? She was a flipping goddess now! She should be able to hold for as long and as much as she liked. Why did gods have limits anyway? Doesn't that define the purpose of being immortal? It wasn't fair!

After hours of lying awake with her legs shaking, Psyche’s tired mind finally settled on a sad truth. She had to pee. Psyche would never be able to get to sleep if her bladder stayed this full. But still, the goddess of souls refused to empty it all! If only there was some way to measure so she wouldn’t let out too much…

Looking at the dark ground, Psyche found her answer…

Psyche reached down and pulled one of her empty nectar bottles up onto the bed. The opening was a little smaller than a drachma. If Psyche angled carefully, she might be able to make it.

In a fit of horniness, the goddess of the soul quickly tore her toga to the side and placed the bottle as far against her pee hole as it would go. As soon as the empty bottle was in place, Psyche let loose. She allowed her tired muscles to calm down and contract. And as soon as they did, a fountain of hot piss blasted from Psyche’s cooch and quickly sped to the top of the bottle. Psyche moaned, quickly stopping her stream. She admired her handwork. She managed to fill this single bottle in less than five seconds. Psyche could feel herself orgasm, her whole body trembling with erotic feelings as she drained the pent-up piss from her pressurized pee pouch!

Psyche carefully set the almost overflowing bottle of piss back to her cave floor. That helped a bit, but Psyche feared she still wouldn’t be able to sleep. So, she grabbed a second bottle and spent the next ten seconds filling this one.

Bottle after bottle Psyche refilled them with golden nectar. Just a different kind of nectar this time! Kidney nectar to be precise! Psyche had to urinate so badly, she managed to fill these relatively large bottles in a matter of seconds. After filling half a dozen bottles, Psyche stood and carefully rearranged these six large bottles of urine on her trunk. Psyche admired the bubbly golden water. She couldn’t believe all of this came out of her! It was just one urination and she still had loads more in the tank!

Psyche just felt so naughty and rambunctious. She was a grown woman pissing into bottles and leaving them all around. Just holding her pee felt so wrong. Her whole life her parents told her to go when she had to go. But now… What would her parents say about this? What would her sisters say about this? What would Eros say about this? Psyche wished Eros would flap his wings in here and give her a nice, hard spanking. She deserved it for being so naughty! Should Psyche tell Eros about this? No. He wouldn’t understand. As the goddess of the human soul, Psyche vowed to take this to her grave.

Psyche picked up one of the bottles and carefully, without spilling, ran the warm bottle over her face. It was so warm, it was like sitting around a campfire. Psyche’s pee even smelled good! Psyche’s entire body trembled with excitement and indecency. The goddess of the soul couldn’t wait for her big release!

Having happily drained one-tenth of her bladder’s pressure, Psyche set down the bottle, eagerly leaped into bed, and prayed to Hypnos for a good night's sleep. But with all of her excitement - for the first time since their marriage - Psyche completely forgot about Eros.

Psyche awoke with aches and pains covering her body. Her sleep was pretty okay, but her bladder was screaming for release. That pressure Psyche had taken off of her bladder last night paled in comparison to how much she still held back. If anything, it appeared like her bladder had grown since last night!

As Psyche prepared to turn over in bed, she saw a black shadow that made her spring up as if someone had replaced her mattress with nails. Standing off to the side, hunched over, observing Psyche’s now freezing cold pee bottles… Was Eros his black shadowy wings flapping lightly, feathers molting off, his eyes affixed upon Psyche’s bottle tinkle.

Hearing a soft noise, Eros turned. Eros and Psyche’s eyes met. Psyche felt herself go beat red. Eros looked down at Psyche’s tummy. That only made the soul goddess go even more red. Psyche was instantly awake. Her heart pounded, her bladder throbbed, and her head spun with fear, all as she awaited her husband’s reaction.

“What’s this?” Eros asked.

Before she even had time to think over her answer, Psyche spit out, “What’s what?”

“This?” Eros pointed to the bottles. “They don't smell too good. Is that pee?” Psyche sweat. “And why is your stomach so bloated?” Eros added. Psyche wished she could just have a heart attack. Can gods even get heart attacks? Psyche wished she had never come back to life. This was the most humiliated she has ever been! “Psyche?” Eros stepped forward and placed a hand on his wife’s shoulder. “You can talk to me,” he said calmly. “No more secrets, remember?”

Psyche knew he was referring to when they first met. Eros had been sent by his mother to make Psyche fall in love with a monster. Psyche was even more beautiful than Aphrodite. Naturally, Aphrodite wanted Psyche and her social life destroyed. Instead, Eros fell in love with Psyche. But thanks to his mother, he couldn’t tell Psyche who he was. So, Eros asked his servant, Zephyrus, the west wind god to bring Psyche to him. Eros and Psyche lived together for several weeks, but Eros forbade Psyche from looking him in the face. Fortunately, this was rather easy as Eros had the ability to turn invisible. Except for when he was asleep that is. But after being convinced by her sisters, one night Psyche looked upon Eros as he slept. Long story short, Eros flew away heartbroken, Pan comforted Psyche, and Psyche had to do three challenges for Aphrodite to prove herself, it was a whole mess.

“I promised to no longer keep secrets from you,” Eros sat beside his wife, holding his arm around her. “Please don’t keep secrets from me.”

Psyche didn’t know if it was just his words or the way he said it, but she told him everything. At first, she was just impressed with the captivity of her godly bladder and wished to test it out. But then, Psyche began to enjoy the arousing feeling of a heavy bladder. Unable to sleep with so much inside, she peed into half a dozen bladders but that barely took down the pressure. Only enough to sleep for the night.

“You must think I’m sick,” Psyche held her head. As she talked, she continued to run her hand over her bladder. It felt too good to stop. “But pee is just so warm and comforting,” Psyche protested. “And I am so impressed with myself, babe! Even as a mortal, my bladder was pretty big. I had relatively good holding power even back then. But now… I haven’t pissed fully in a week and I peed six whole bottles without breaking a sweat!”

“Godly bladders are pretty cool, huh?” Eros smiled.

“They are!” Psyche wailed. Psyche smiled down at her bladder bump, continuing to lightly massage it. “This is my favorite part of being a goddess!”

Psyche quickly caught herself. “Besides being married to you of course.”

The god of love chucked. “And no,” he said. “I don’t think you are sick. Babe, as the god of love, I know all about fetishes! We are all into something and yours is fairly normal.”

Psyche hesitated. “It is?”

Eros shrugged. “Compared to most sexual things… Yeah.” Eros ran a hand over Psyche’s back. “Don’t feel bad, babe. I think it is kind of hot you’re into something so… Bizarre!”

Psyche knew she should tell her husband. Eros was so understanding and empathetic! “Hey…” Psyche stopped herself.

“What?” Eros prompted.

Psyche used her finger to trace circles around her bulge. “It’s nothing.”

“No, tell me.”

“Nothing…”

“Psyche…”

“Okay, okay… I was just wondering…” Psyche slowly looked up. “Would you… Yeh know… Be down to… Play… With me?”

“You mean the urine thing?”

Psyche turned pale. “Yeah…”

Eros’ wings fluttered softly behind him. “I would be honored.”

Psyche resumed her lying down position. Eros knelt on the bed over his wife and rested his fingertips on her bladder. Eros gently pushed his fingers farther into the rock-like texture of his wife’s urinary bladder. Eros then raised his fingers to the sky and pressed his wrists into her tender skin. Psyche felt countless twinges in her bladder following the added pressure of her husband’s hands.

“My bladder feels like an ocean,” Psyche moaned.

“Mumph.”

“Like my bladder is a slave to the rest of my body,” Psyche rolled her head back and forth. “The caged-up urine hurrrrrts…” Psyche extended the word via a moan.

“I know, baby,” Eros replied gently. “Do you wish me to stop?”

“Gods no,” Psyche gasped. “It feels too damn good…”

Psyche could feel her clit as hard as her bladder. The bladder pain was accompanied by a twitching pee hole. Psyche knew she would be unable to bare the pressure much longer. But she wanted this moment to last for all of eternity. Eros was in on her secret and he was playing with her and her bulge. What more could a goddess ask for?

Eros pressed his entire elbow down into Psyche’s bladder. The pressure made her salivate. Psyche begged her sphincter to stay closed. Not because she was afraid of wetting. But because she didn’t want this moment to end.

This whole situation seemed so improper and wicked. And those very thoughts only made the stiffness of Psyche’s clitoris increase.

Eros was quiet the entire time. Psyche felt as if he was mesmerized by her bladder as much as she was. Her theory was further backed up by the fact that Eros’ pupils never once diverged from the massive bump that was Psyche’s inflated piss bag.

After another hour of Eros’ poking and prodding, the love god being silent the whole time, he finally asked, “Have you always been into this stuff?”

“No,” Psyche bit down hard on her lip on a particularly sharp push from Eros. “as a mortal, I never held my pee. My parents told me it was wrong and I suppose as a mortal it is kind of unhealthy. Even as a goddess, I never went crazy withholding. Until now that is. And I love it!” Psyche’s legs were crossed as tight as bandits hold onto a treasure. “I hate to say it, babe, but I gotta piss soon…”

“Just let me know when you’re at your limit,” Eros replied.

As Eros continued to press down on the soul goddess’ bulge, Psyche’s mind began racing and she thought of where she would empty. She didn’t want to use her chamber pot. One, her volume of piss proudly wouldn’t fit inside it and two, Psyche wanted to do it somewhere naughtier! And she knew just the place. But how would Eros react?

“Babe,” Psyche said a moment later, reaching her hand over her mountain of a bladder to grasp her furry vulva. “It’s time.”

Eros’ expression went in stages upon hearing his wife’s request. First, it was surprising then disgusted then worry then deep in thought, and finally, he settled on mischievous.

Psyche first got completely naked, allowing her perky breasts to bounce around. Having accidentally seen her mother-in-law naked once, Psyche knew that Aphrodite was right… Psyche was hotter than her! While Psyche’s boobs weren’t nearly as big as the goddess of love’s, they were a lot fuller and perfectly symmetrical. Psyche kind of felt like she had three breasts given how massive her bladder had gotten. But even then, her bladder completely overshadowed her boobs!

Psyche and Eros ventured to the end of the cave. And there, they came face to face with the infinite number of gravestones.

“You sure about this?” Eros asked nervously.

“These gravestones are here pretty much just to keep track of all the souls in the underworld,” Psyche explained.

“I thought that was your job as the goddess of souls,” Eros pointed out.

Ignoring this comment, Psyche said, “It is not like real people are buried here. They are all buried below the surface of the earth.”

“Okay, if you insist,” Eros said. Judging by the crotch area of Eros’ toga, Psyche could tell he was aroused. That was good enough for her.

Standing up, Psyche moderately moved her pussy lips higher up than they were supposed to be. Then… She gave in to the pressure and allowed her bladder to drain. Relief washed over the goddess of the soul’s face. Psyche happily wagged her labia around, showering an entire row of tombstones in golden nectar twice. Psyche went around the graveyard, pissing on each and every stone she could.

“Some for you. And some for you. And a little for you. Don’t worry, you’ll all get my lovely hot hiss,” Psyche giggled to the headstones.

Eros just watched. His penis grew sturdier and sturdier with each passing second. It got to the point that a pitched tent was clearly visible, making Eros’ lower toga stick out.

Psyche laughed like crazy as she drained her exploding bladder all over the tombstones, showering each and everyone in her blessed yellow water. Psyche’s bladder pressure slowly decreased as the goddess of the soul emptied it all over the graveyard. Psyche knew that she and Eros would have to do stuff like this more often. For now, each of them was flaring with sexual excitement.

This next story is another male omo story. It centers around the hero of Hawaiian mythology. The one, the only, Maui!

Maui used his powerful fish hook to slice through the reeds, finding himself on the white beach. His bare toes sank down into the sandy earth. The sand felt as warm as the inside of his bladder walls. Maui was unconsciously sliding each leg in turn up the opposite leg. Maui allowed each leg to climb the other, brushing against his very full penis. The trickster shoved his hand down his loincloth and gave himself a strong grab of his junk to help him control the urge better.

“Hey, lazy daisy!” called Maui’s brother, Maui-roto. “You coming or what?”

Maui’s mouth hung half open. “Yeah,” the hero muttered.

The cawing of sea birds hung above him. The lapping of the ocean waves against the shore sent daggers into Maui’s already overflowing urinary bladder. The white sea foam sloshing across the surf reminded Maui of his growing need.

Maui would normally announce right then and there that he was going for a piss. But it was hard enough to convince his brothers to allow him to go fishing with them. Maui didn’t want to blow his chances now that he was so very close. His brothers already found him to be nothing more than a lazy, arrogant and reckless person. The last thing Maui needed was to reveal what he had brewing in his pelvis.

Maui sucked in his breath, wrestled with his shaking member one final time, and charged down the beach. His brothers were waiting by a long canoe, each one holding a fish hook in hand.

“Hey, all set to go,” Maui said, forcing himself to stand as straight as a full-bladdered trickster could.

The brothers’ conversion halted as they looked upon their least favorite of brothers. Maui feared his brothers were suddenly having second thoughts about allowing Maui to come along. After months of relentless begging did they finally say yes, if nothing more than to shut him up? Now, did they freit taking him once more.

Maui knew he would once again have to rely on his cunning to reassure his brothers into taking him along for the ride.

Before he could, however, Brother Maui-taha said something unexpected. “Wow, Maui, are you okay? Your stomach looks all… Puffy.”

Maui didn’t understand at first. But upon looking down at his belly, Maui did realize that bloated wasn’t even beginning to describe the bulge that stood from his abdomen. It looked like Maui was pregnant with a calabash. His stomach was just as big, round, and hairless as the fruit.

Maui felt his face fill with burning sand of embarrassment. “I’m fine,” he lied. “Just have to take a leak.” As badly as Maui dreaded informing his brothers of this, he knew there was no way he could escape the truth right now. Unless his brothers were stupid enough to believe him to be pregnant - and they were some of the smartest men on the island of Maui - Maui doubted he could fool them with anything but honesty.

“Do you want to go?” Maui-pae said a little too quickly.

Maui knit his eyes at his older brother. Oh, sure, have the guy go pee and then sail off while he was gone. Maui invented that old trick! Maui was not leaving this spot unless he was on a canoe and that was final!

“I’m fine,” Maui’s voice came out extra shrill. “I’m the son of the moon goddess, Hina. I can hold it.”

“We’re all children of Hina,” Maui-waho pointed out.

“And none of you were born with any godly abilities,” Maui said, harsher than he intended. But it was also true, out of Hina and the mortal Akalana's six children, Maui was the only one with divine powers - powers he inherited from his mother. “Trust me, I can hold my piss. I’m covered in muscles for Kāne’s,” (the chief Hawaiian god). “Sake. Naturally, my bladder is extra strong as well.”

The four other brothers had looks that ranged from disappointment to concert to just plain old irritation at Maui’s existence. Maui didn’t know what he ever did to them! Sure, he had a tendency to be lazy from time to time, but he also did a lot of good for humanity. How could his brothers deny that?

Finally settling for Maui’s promises of abate, the brothers returned to the raft. As the four brothers pushed the canoe down the sandy slope, Maui-waho said, “I hope Ku will provide us with fresh fish today.” The god of war guided the migrations of fish and aided sailors in their fishing game. If Ku was in a good mood, he may allow the brothers to catch some fish.

“He better,” Maui-pae said, swinging his legs in the boat. “If not, mother and sister will go hungry.”

“Come on, Maui, move it!” Maui-roto exclaimed, splashing through the water up onto the canoe.

Maui stood on the shore, watching as his brothers navigated the boat out to sea. Maui’s eyes reflected splashes of water. Maui’s bladder tensed upon watching water hiss and splash all around the canoe. Maui’s gaze remained fixed on the vast open sea. The ocean was so ginormous, just the thought of all that H2O made Maui’s intestines become bogged down with damp watery frustration.

Maui shuffled both hands down his loincloth. His penis thrashed around like an angry snake. The trickster still refused to give into his bodily needs. He was ashamed of himself for acting so weak. And in front of his brothers, no less. Maui was in fact a demigod. And unlike his siblings, mother Hina gave him a vast amount of abilities and powers. Like shapeshifting for one. Maui was a whiz at playing hide-and-seek with his brothers due to his ability to transform into insects. Maui wished he could turn into some animal with a larger bladder captivity. Maybe then he would have a better chance of holding. But he didn’t want to capsize the boat… Or let his brothers know how bad his need was. Still, Maui was certain the minute he stepped a toenail into the cool Hawaiian waves, he would burst like an old papaya falling from the top of the tree.

The canoe was beginning to sail away, and Maui was running out of time to get on board.

“I told you guys,” Maui-roto snarled. “Maui is as lazy as ever. He would do anything to get out of doing work.”

Maui’s eyes switched from water to flames. Anger at such a comment filled Maui’s chest. At that moment, the hero’s bladder bulge was forgotten. All Maui knew was the need to prove his brothers wrong was far superior to the needs of his bladder. Maui raced down the sands, flying over the waves in large sprints, and Maui jumped into the air, smashing his weight down into the canoe.

The canoe rattled and rocked side to side like an untrained hula dancer. Towering waves shot up on all perimeters of the boat. Maui was large to begin with, but that added bladder strength made jumping into the canoe as dangerous as swallowing a fire rock before cliff diving into a volcano.

“Maui, take it easy,” Maui-taha’s voice was broken apart by his body’s constant shaking. The other brothers managed to hold tight to the railings as the shaking slowly came to a stop and the waves fell back into the sea.

“This isn’t a game, Maui,” Maui-roto snapped. “What are you trying to do, get up swallowed by the surf?”

“Watch it, Maui, okay,” Maui-pae warned. “Be careful from now on unless you want the fish to be scared away,”

“Okay, okay, sorry,” Maui grunted, growing exhausted from his brother’s constant nagging. “Let’s just sail out to sea. And sail far away from land too.”

“Why?” demanded Maui-taha.

“Just do it,” snapped Maui. Maui had a little secret up his sleeve that he didn’t want to share with his siblings. Not yet, he would wait until they were in the optimal location. And that location was still a long distance away. “Trust me,” Maui assured them. “I know the perfect fishing spot.”

“How can you possibly know a good fishing spot?” Maui-waho wondered. “You’ve never even been fishing before? You usually sleep until noon and we are long gone by then.”

Maui gritted his teeth. Maui told himself that the next brother that commented on his laziness would get a nice, wet golden shower. Taking a seat on the canoe with crossed legs, Maui replied, “I’ve heard things. Just trust me, you guys.”

They didn’t. Against the brother’s better judgment, they agreed to Maui’s proposal and allowed Maui to direct them to this ‘perfect fishing spot.’

The bad news was that it was far away. While the brothers didn’t mind rowing to such a specific location, Maui’s bladder was feeling heavier each minute they remained at sea. Maui imagined the entire Pacific Ocean sloshing between his bladder walls, being held back by his sphincter. Maui came closer and closer to forming a ditch of gold liquid right here in the canoe. He imagined his penis spraying all over the wooden boat, drenching his brothers and all their equipment. Maui knew his brothers would kill him. How he desired to take a leak over the edge of the boat, but they would probably kill him for that too. If nothing else, they would be disguised and chastise him about scaring the fish away.

As the boat sailed on and the waves continued to splash, Maui’s mind was stuck on his relentless need to drain the fishpond inside his body.

Furthermore, Maui was struggling even more to keep still and disguise his need. He tried placing his fish hook between his legs and rocking around on it, but since he had a penis, that did little to help ease the discomfort. Maui racked his brain of ways to distract himself, but seeing as he was at sea, that was even more difficult.

When a particularly nasty wave of urinary urgency rocked Maui’s weakening sphincter, Maui had no choice but to openly snap at his member. Giving a tight squeeze to his shaft, Maui massaged his poor trembling demigodhood. This was ridiculous! Maui was a demigod of the moon! He should be able to control the flood. But Maui was finding that to be more and more difficult as time wore on and the brothers grew more distant from the land and by extension, more distance from a chamber pot.

Maui’s brothers spotted him holding himself. Maui-taha was the first to notice, followed by Maui-roto who eagerly tapped Maui-waho to get his attention and show off their younger brother’s bladder torment. Maui-pae soon saw and all the brothers eyed Maui with amusement.

“You okay, Maui?” asked Maui-taha - the only brother who looked the tiniest bit concerned.

“Yeah… Fine… Why…” Maui’s teeth remained wedged together while his hands fought against his junk.

“What are you doing, bro?” Maui-waho’s voice teased.

Panicked, Maui said the first thing that came to mind. “Masturbating.”

The brothers laughed.

“Masturbating?” Maui-pae asked. “Seriously?”

“Yeah,” Maui said, growing more confident. “That’s how hard core I am! I’m playing with myself and I don’t give two alea bird droppings who sees!” Even as he said this, Maui’s desperate mind forced him to rise from his seat and fall back down repetitively.

“Why are you moving so much then?” Maui-waho challenged.

“Hey, I don’t make fun of the way you masturbate,” Maui pointed out. “Let me do my thing please, thank you…” Maui moved his hand in a motion akin to masturbation. In reality, however, he was squeezing his aching penile parts with all the remaining energy he had.

“Maui, you sure this doesn't make you uncomfortable?” Maui-roto splashed his oar up and down in the waves, forcing waves the size of ant hills to be removed from the sea for a split second, long enough to torture Maui, before splashing back down.

Maui wanted to rip off his eyes and ears so he wouldn’t have to see nor hear such a terrible sight/noise. The water show caused the trickster to roll his butt around on his seat, trying - and failing to get comfortable. The pressure Maui felt inside was like an internal switch that forced him to move. Maui was unable to sit still, if he did, he would pee, as simple as that.

“Look at this massive salty ocean. So much wet, wonderful, water,” Maui-pae added on. “Just think of what it would be like to be a squid or a whale. Able to sink below the waves, constantly living in a vast open watery sea, able to piss whenever they like. Just imagine the yellow clouds that come from urinating underwater.”

“Don’t I love to splash and flop around the sea,” Maui-waho continued. “I just love to do cannonballs into the sea. I especially love cliff diving off the edge of a waterfall. Falling parallel to the age-old running water of the falls, having the water displaced as you hit the sea, it is truly the best feeling ever.”

“That’s enough, guys,” said Maui-taha, the oldest and thus the most responsible.

Maui refused to let his brothers get to him. But all of those descriptions of water… Maui’s thoughts were filled with splashing cannonballs and yellow clouds of pee under the sea and running waterfalls. Maui was unable to get these dreaded images out of his tired mind. The pressure continued to climb and Maui’s bladder was burning hot.

Maui was a demigod! He could handle this. But as this torment went on, Maui’s confidence sank to the depths of the sea. His bladder was bubbling and frothing more than the ocean itself. Maui’s penis was brandishing back and forth like a fish on a line. Maui continued to grope his manhood, urging his urine to stay inside just for a little while longer.

“Maui, just don’t think of all the fish swimming below the depths,” Maui-roto said quietly with a grin.

“I said that’s enough,” Maui-taha snapped, silencing his brothers’ snickering.

The raft continued to float farther and farther away from land, nearer to Maui’s selected fishing spot. No one said another word until they arrived. But Maui’s bladder continued to rant and bellow its fury at Maui the entire way. And each time the hero felt salty sea water splash onto his skin, he felt himself nearing his limit. At one point, a splash of cold water hit his distended stomach, which normally may have been refreshing, only aided Maui’s discomfort and made him wince in pain. The cold water sent agony all throughout his lower body and Maui could feel his sphincter wither away like his freshly deceased ancestors.

“Okay, this is good,” Maui breathed, relieved that the first stretch of the journey was done. If only Maui was in proper health to fulfill the rest of his plan.

“This spot better be good if you made us come out all this way, lazy daisy,” Maui-roto warned, throwing his line into the sea.

“Oh, it will be,” Maui squeezed his penis and then tossed his own fish hook below the depths. Maui’s eyes watered as he watched his hook sink with a plunk.

Maui’s eyelids slammed closed as the trickster rocked around in pure agony. He had to focus and concentrate on his fishing line. But how could he concentrate on anything other than his ever-expanding bladder walls? Maui wanted to scream to the heavens he found himself in so much unbearable pain. Against all odds, Maui managed to regain control and push his thoughts of urine aside. Maui visualized his fish hook sinking lower and lower into the darkest parts of the sea. The idea of which only added to Maui’s urgency, yet he contented to imagine his hook vanishing into the folds of oceanic darkness.

Maui soon felt his hook snag on something solid and the line tugged. This was it, this was Maui’s moment. “Guys, I think I got something!” Maui cried, beginning to reel in his catch.

After failing to catch anything in the first round, Maui-pae threw out his line a second time. “Yeah, right,” he scoffed.

“No, really,” Maui insisted. As if on cue, Maui’s fishing line dragged down even lower into the tide. Maui kept a firm grip on his pole, all while trying not to lose a grip on his sphincter muscles. “Look!” Maui cried.

One by one, the brothers reluctantly turned to the youngest. Just as Maui stated, his fishing line was weighed down heavily with his mighty catch. The entire canoe began to shake on the waves, getting pulled down along with Maui’s hook.

“My gods, Maui!” shouted Maui-taha. “What did you catch? A piece of land?”

Hiding his smile in his shoulder blade, Maui cried, “Just help me pull!” Maui found himself nearly getting thrown overboard. The splashes of water on his face, the constant movement of his body and the ship, Maui felt each bump, each splash jolted the core of Maui’s bladder which was starting to feel more and more like Nāmaka’s most violent sea storm each passing second.

Maui’s brothers all chipped in. Abandoning their own poles, all five brothers held onto Maui’s and they all tugged as a single unit. The fishing line was pulled from the water, but instantly went back under. The ocean began to churn and the sea bubbled. A wave larger than any they had ever seen rose from the ocean floor. The tidal wave grew to the size of a mountain. Maui and his brothers found their canoe trapped on the summit of the massive wave.

“I’ll keep pulling! You guys row the boat forward,” Maui ordered. “Oh, and don’t look back! You don’t want to scare the fish.” Maui had the hunch his brothers found that last command to be off-putting. And why wouldn’t they? Telling someone not to look behind them is a rather strange instruction, in retrospect. Given the situation, they were currently in, however, no one had time to argue with such an odd suggestion.

The four elder brothers all assumed their roles at the oars. As soon as they released their hold on Maui, the trickster was almost thrown from the raft. Somehow, he managed to bare his footing and remained lodged on the railing of the canoe. All four brothers paddled with all their strength, pulling the canoe forward. Maui remained on the stern where he stood on two legs, placing one foot on the edge of the boat, and constantly yanking his line along with them.

Standing up was even worse than sitting for Maui’s bodily needs. Maui found the pressure of his bladder sank down in his abdomen, pressing on his sphincter. The pressure felt as if two squids were tugging Maui’s bladder in two opposite directions. Maui gritted his teeth and tried to ignore it. But with a climbing tidal wave right in front of his eyes, Maui’s refusal to recognize his urgent need was quickly diminished.

The sight of such a massive wave deeply damaged Maui’s continence. Maui’s bladder stung with the fury of all the jellyfish in the sea. Curse the Hawaiian’s mostly juice diet! If only Maui had gotten a chance to pee sooner! Sadly, just as his brothers teased him of, he woke up late. Come to think of it, Maui hasn’t pissed in well over a day. He was too busy goofing around yesterday to do so. As the son of a goddess - the only one among his siblings to gain any divine powers - Maui had inhuman levels of control and colossal captivity. Not as much as a god, but similar to one. But after twenty-four hours with no chamber pot and a diet of many different juices, Maui was absolutely bursting open. Maui desired to clutch himself, but he refused to take a single hand off his pole. Rather, Maui held his flood at bay with nothing but his sheer muscles.

Maui continued to remind himself that he was in fact a demigod. He was the same demigod who pulled up the sky, lassoed the sun, harnessed the winds, surely he could handle a little bit of urine in his bladder. The entire island of Maui was named after him for the gods’ sake!

Still, the feeling of salt water soaked his face, and such a refreshing wet aura forced the demigod’s bladder to twist itself into a tight knot. Maui felt a hot iron inside his pelvis and he was just dying to let it go.

The canoe rode on the wave, sailing like a surfboard, gliding on the sea foam. The brothers continued to paddle all while being chased by a tsunami. Maui pressed his legs together, feeling his twitching penis between them. Maui let out a quiet moan as he continued to tug on his pole.

“This is ridiculous,” called Maui-roto. “What on earth are we…” Maui-roto turned around and his voice became dead in the water. The rest of the brothers - wondering what rendered their brother speechless - followed in his lead and also looked behind them.

The waves finally began to subside and crash back into the still-churning sea. Standing before the brothers, just casually resting in the ocean, was a massive collection of land. It was an entire island! Maui’s hook was still wedged on the coast of the large island. Maui tugged on his pole one final time and the hook shot from the crevice it made in the land and was reeled back in by a victorious Maui.

“Is that…” Maui-pae’s voice also died in his throat.

“An island?” gasped Maui-taha. “Maui, you…” Maui-taha swallowed. “Fished up an entire island.”

“How in the gods’ name is this possible?” Maui-waho rubbed the back of his neck.

Maui-roto looked faint. “It’s not just a little island, either… It’s massive! This thing is larger than all of the Hawaiian islands put together!”

“I call it… New Zealand!” Maui established the land.

“New Zealand? Why?” Maui-waho wondered.

“It’s a new land from the sea,” Maui replied. “Zea sounds like sea, new land mass, it’s like a…”

“We get the picture,” Maui-pae promised. “This is highly impressive, Maui. I can’t believe…”

“Oh, we’re not done yet!” Maui called.

The four brother’s faces became a sea of bewilderment.

“We’re not?” Maui-taha asked.

“Nope, we have one more island to fish up,” Maui replied. The shock Maui’s brothers had instantly made up for all the teasing they gave him all these years. It even made Maui temporarily forget about the big ball of urine begging to spray out. Maui directed his brothers to the second site.

“How do you know of these sunken lands, Maui?” Maui-taha asked as the four brothers rowed along.

“Let’s just say, I’ve visited our ancestors in the underworld plenty of times, and they tell me little worldly secrets.” Maui admired his fish hook, the same one he collected from his deceased, unpleasant grandmother’s jawbone.

As the brothers rowed the canoe around the new landmass, Maui was able to relax for a moment, soaking in the astonishment of his siblings. Maui couldn’t wait for the world to hear about this newly accomplished great deed of his. Maui’s list of great deeds was getting longer and longer, and with it, Maui’s reputation was growing as well. All of that was well worth holding last night’s juice a little while longer.

As the canoe sailed on, and the brothers passed a much more open ocean, Maui’s urge quickly escalated again. Maui soon found himself having to squeeze his shaft again. This time, having learned from past mistakes, Maui placed his back on his brothers. He pretended he was only facing such a way so he could scout out the sea, but in actuality, he was holding onto his throbbing cock for dear life, fighting away the urine pressure that was urging him to let go. Maui moaned in silence, rubbing his penis, battling with his own body on the fluid which pressed down harder than ever into his sphincter.

Eventually, Maui once again commanded his brothers to stop. He told them to do what they did last time and row the boat while he fished. The brothers obeyed, gripping their oars tightly. Maui again swung his pole and watched as the nearly invisible string was thrown over the side of the sea vessel and disappeared below the crystal blue sea. It wasn’t long until Maui’s hook snagged another piece of land.

“Got it,” Maui muttered. The demigod began to tug once again. Just like before, a mountainous wave lifted from the sea. The canoe once again was thrown forward, riding the top of the wave. While the four older brothers rowed, Maui stood at the stern, pulling on his fishing line. Maui found this experience ever more gruesome than the last island he fished. Now, Maui’s bladder was even more swollen than before. The entire thing felt rock hard in his stomach and it hurt so badly, Maui felt ready to collapse in a fit of his own tears. Maui hadn’t been this drained since he lifted the sky on his shoulders.

The tidal wave rushed after the canoe and still, Maui yanked on his pole. Maui had already fished up one island, he now had one left to obtain. Maui couldn’t turn back now. Silencing his bladder’s protests was no longer an option, however. Maui’s water-logged pelvis was shouting at him the entire time. Having ocean water constantly chase the bulge only made it that much more angry. The wall of water pursued the boat. The hero and his brothers were lifted above the world on the largest wave ever seen in the Pacific.

Maui’s bladder cramped and his knees stuck together. Maui no longer had the strength to place one foot on the end of the boat. While that gave him extra strength to pull up the island, Maui’s bladder would no longer permit him to separate his legs for even a split millisecond. Pressure filled the trickster’s pelvis. He wanted to scream louder than ever. His muscles ached from all the pulling of land and the pushing back of his full bladder. Two intense forces pulled Maui in different directions and it was a pain to fight off both of them.

After much more pulling, a second island stood right beside the first one. The waves crashed back down into the sea and the two combined senses of sight and sound made Maui nearly lose control and piss right then and there.

The brothers all chanted, lifting from their seats, and clapping Maui on the back. With all four speaking at once, Maui had no clue what any of them were saying. All he knew was many praises and compliments were thrown his way. As much as Maui loved this attention from his - usually cruel - brothers, at the moment, the pressure inside his hero’s body was too great, he could not focus on anything.

The force of an overflowing urinary bladder nearly knocked Maui to his knees. He imagined bubbles rising up in his bladder, just as they do in the ocean. His internal yellow sea was frothing with white sea foam. His bladder walls were glowing red with fire, furious at being ignored for so long. Maui felt the pressure rocket down his shaft and settle in the head of his penis. Maui anxiously rubbed the head, trying to silence the urgency of his badly needed urination. The head of Maui’s penis contained so much pressure, the trickster was highly surprised it didn’t just explode off. Maui imagined his entire genitalia swelling with piss pressure, urine flooding the shaft, banging against the orifice of his body, demanding to be drained right away.

Bladder rocking with waves of urine, all crashing violently into the bladder walls, Maui briefly debated transforming into a bird and flying back to the island of Maui so he could visit the little trickster’s room. Even though flying back to Maui in bird form would be faster than sailing on a canoe, it would still take a while. And Maui would probably be weighed down by his heavy bladder the entire trip. There was no way he would make it, even in bird form. Maui didn’t have time to waste on such futile courses of action. He would have to settle for something far more embarrassing yet safer and much more pleasing.

Maui tugged on his line, tearing his fish hook from the second New Zealand island. Maui angrily slammed his mighty fish hook into the open arms of Maui-waho.

Prancing up and down, bending his knees in and out, Maui threw up his loincloth. “I gotta void!” Maui shouted, no longer caring what his brothers thought. The pressure was far too great, and the hero had been suffering for far too long. Maui finally made his brothers proud of him and earned their approval. Now there was only one thing left to do. Screw the chamber pot! Maui had a wide-open urination spot right in front of him and it's name was the ocean!

When Maui lifted his malo loincloth, his penis dangled free and exposed, hanging above the sea. Maui’s heavily tattooed skin dripped of both seawater and sweat. Between pulling up land from the sea floor and holding back his bladder, Maui’s body was covered head to toe in perspiration.

With a vibrating cock hanging limp above the open ocean, Maui opened his floodgates and allowed the yellow tsunami to begin. There was an instant rush of liquid shooting down the trickster's shaft. Out of said shaft came a monstrous roar of urine which blasted from Maui’s whimpering pee hole and fired down into the sea. Maui’s solid stream of gold rained down into the blue sea. The ocean rippled and the surface was pulled apart. In the epicenter of the sea ripples was a bright yellow stream that touched the water and sent a gurgling noise to the clouds.

Maui’s shoulders untensed. The trickster’s sweaty lips uncurled. Maui’s eyes became softer than bananas. Maui hollered his relief to the heavens. Holding his loincloth high, he allowed his penis to do its thing and fill the ocean with his salty juices.

Maui’s brothers all stood back, both appalled and impressed Maui had such guts to simply evacuate his bladder into the sea like this. Especially in such close quarters. Maui’s member hissed a violent stream. His urethral opening appeared like a crying insect eyeball. Maui happily drained his monster into the ocean depths. Maui’s body flooded with gratification. Maui suddenly felt a tad bit horny from such a wondrous piss!

“Feel better, Maui?” Maui-pae asked with a grin.

“You better believe it, boys!” Maui shouted. “I managed to pull two massive islands from the sea and have an orgasmic piss in one day!”

“Very nice,” Maui-taha found himself with crossed legs. The violent blast from Maui’s cock reminded the eldest of his own needs. “I could kind of go for a pee myself, actually.”

“Now that you mention it,” Maui-roto smirked.

“I could micturate,” Maui-pae added.

“I want to pee in the sea!” Maui-waho cried.

Maui’s four brothers lined the railing, standing alongside the youngest. All brothers lifted their loincloths and unclenched their muscles, allowing their bladders to empty into the urethra tube which sprayed out of the penis. All five going hands-free, the five men peed into the ocean. Five penises sprayed five streams, all of which turned the ocean water a quick shade of green. The ocean filled with urine. Maui wouldn’t have been surprised if his urine alone was enough to turn the sea permanently yellow. Maui has a demigod bladder, after all, his limit is huge!

All five men stood back, enjoying the satisfying feeling of urine washing through their shafts and tumbling down into the wide open sea below them. It wasn’t long until Maui-waho’s penis dribbled its last drops. Soon after, Maui-taha’s penis ran dry and he gave it a gentle shake. Maui-pae’s bladder was the next to fully finish its task. Maui-pae gave his shaft a quick stroke and let his loincloth fall back in place. Maui-roto ended his pee half a minute later and had to give a slight push to drain the last spurt.

Maui’s brothers, all finished with their own urinations, sat back on the raft and waited patiently for their youngest brother to end his unplanned bathroom break. The four brothers spent their time waiting and admiring the massive islands Maui fished from the sea. Both islands were similar in size, covered in mountains and valleys, they were gorgeous. How one man could bring such massive islands up, the brothers had no clue. But Maui did inherit the strength of a god.

Maui couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. Aside from the orgasmic feeling that came with a drop in full bladder pressure, Maui was beyond proud of himself. He brought up two new islands and earned his brother’s respect. So much so that they were willing to pee with him. Maui knew if he lost control and pissed over the edge of the boat a few hours ago, they would have found him a disgrace. But now… Now they viewed him as one of them.

Maui wondered if his mother, Hina the moon goddess was watching him. He hoped she was… Well, he didn’t really like the idea of his mom watching him urinate… But he would love to know that she was watching him complete his trails. Sure, Maui and his mother had never seen eye to eye, but he hoped she too was proud of him.

If nothing else, Hina should be proud of her son’s divine bladder. Nearly five minutes in and Maui was still gushing like a garden hose. Maui may not be a god, but as a demigod, his bladder took a while to properly drain. Especially when it was this full.

As Maui reached minute six, his stream began to waver and after a few final, shorter jets, Maui was done. His urine mixed with the sea and Maui was relaxed. Maui crashed onto his back on the canoe as his brothers began to sail for home.

“Thanks for the idea, Maui,” Maui-taha wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. “That was a relief!”

Maui just grinned. “What can I say except you’re welcome?”

Even though this adventure was highly exciting and enjoyable, the one problem was, the brothers had yet to catch fish for the family. Seeing as the island of Maui was a while off, the brothers decided to head back and they would do some fishing when they got closer to their homeland. Between the island pulling and all of the peeing, the fish of this area would have been scared off anyway. Maui and his brothers would collect fish closer to home.

Maui had done four great deeds at this point and he planned to do more! With a bladder empty of juice, anything was possible, after all!

*049*2023-05-30 00:34

This next story I wrote is one of my personal favorites. The reason being is that this story is not at all my own imagination and this story actually happened in Norse mythology! Granted, I created the dialogue and all of the extra details, but this event was said to have actually taken place.

Gjálp’s monster feet pounded against the soil, shaking the earth. The giantess lunged across the realm, deeply regretting all that mead. The giantess’ bladder was swollen so large, it could have been used as a marine life sanctuary. After way too much mead and a very long time traveling, Gjálp was gravely in need of a place to micturate.

Gjálp had been forbidden from tending to her bodily needs for three months now. As a giantess, her bladder captivity surprised even that of most of the gods. Given her giantess statue, Gjálp’s bladder was quite literally massive. Gjálp carried an unnatural amount of piss inside her pelvis for a very long time now. Yet, no matter how much Gjálp begged for the outhouse, her father refused her needs. Instead, whenever she asked, he just made her chug another barrel of mead. All because he wished to defeat his greatest foe.

Gjálp and her sister, Gerip, did rock-paper-scissors for this disgraceful task. Sadly, Gjálp lost, hence why she is here. Gjálp grumbled under her breath, already feeling the first leaks begin to dribble down her dress. The Jötunn swore more than any sailor in all the land. Her feet punched the earth, her toes leaving creators in the soil. Gjálp’s target was in sight. Her bladder felt as though it would burst from her abdomen at any moment now.

Gjálp rounded on the river, Vimur. Just as her father had promised, wadding across the stream, halfway through the current was none other than the mighty Thor himself. With his iron-gloved hands, he grasped Mjölnir in one hand and his strong iron staff in the other. The hefty god marched across the river bed. The shallow waters refused to pass his waist. Loki the god of mischief clung in the thunder god’s back. Technically speaking, after Gjálp’s father, Geirrad captured Loki, he promised to let Loki live if Loki brought him Thor. But sacrifices needed to be made for the Jötunn to rid themselves of their worst foe, Thor! Apparently, Loki's life and Gjálp’s bladder were said sacrifices.

Regardless, Gjálp was only mere moments from letting her urine out, and she could not be more happy. Reaching the river, Gjálp threw one leg over to the opposite side of the bank. Stradling the river, Gjálp kept each foot firmly planted on either side of the swift current. Tugging her dress as far up as her chest, the giantess squatted above the river, flashing the icy waters of Vimur, her naked pussy overflowing with fur.

Vimur was the largest river of the known universe. It dated all the way back to the creation of the nine worlds. And Gjálp would have the honor of pissing in it! She had to admit, having the opportunity to wash Thor away and forever rid her people of the blasted thunder god was an amazing chance. Her people would view her as a heroine! Her massive bladder captivity would destroy the very man who has murdered so many Jötunns.

Gjálp watched as Thor struggled to push past a heavy wave that shot at him. The thunder god fought his way forward and continued moving across the river. While Gjálp wasn’t too thrilled that her father refused her relief for so long, she understood his perspective. Thor was seconds from being taken care of! And now it was up to Gjálp to once and for all vanquish the mighty Thor.

So, she adjusted her stance, squatted a tad lower, and opened up her muscles. The feeling of freedom hit Gjálp harder than Vimur’s massive tidal waves. A blow-hole-sized urethra opened its walls wide and out of it came the most violent, messy, chaotic hiss ever heard in the realm of the Vikings. As Gjálp released her urine, steam appeared as the boiling liquid - previously inside her body - now met the freezing Norse air. Gjálp felt as though she was on top of the world. After months of holding back her mead, being forbidden from releasing it, and only adding more drink to the torture, Gjálp was finally allowed to unclench her muscles and give in to her needs. The pressure rapidly drained from Gjálp’s pelvis and instead filled the swift river below her.

Gjálp’s vulva heated up with a sweltering atmosphere of fresh urine. The gush shot from her wide-opened piss hole and fled into the river. The waters rippled and below her, they transformed a light shade of green. The Virmur quickly became flooded with added liquids. The waters billowed skyward, surpassing Thor’s stomach, his chest, and his shoulders. Gjálp felt herself break into a smile, her tusks poking out of the corner of her line of sight. The giantess felt nothing but cheer as her pelvis drained and her people’s arch-enemy became submerged in the current.

As Vimur overflowed, Thor and Loki became lost below its depths. Gjálp’s monster bladder wasn’t even a portion of the way voided yet, and she could barely see Thor or Loki anymore. Who knew the best way to kill Thor was by pissing for a few seconds? That’s all it took. With the mass amount of urine being ejected from her bladder every millisecond, it did not take long for Vimur’s tides to become so unstable and rocky that two of the strongest Aesir were lost below its rising rapid.

“Hey, Thor,” Gjálp shouted, despite no longer seeing the thunder god. “Good riddance! Why don’t you suck my…” Before she could finish her taunt, a tremendous hand, gloved in iron exploded from the waves. Its fingers were curled as though it was holding something.

Splashing from the shaking waters came none other than Thor with Loki still riding piggyback. Loki spit out water and desperately clung to Thor’s shoulders. Panicking now, the god of mischief climbed over Thor’s back and squeezed his face for dear life.

Thor turned to Gjálp. Their eyes locked. The two Aesir gods bobbed along the waves like a sinking ship. Gjálp understood her victory had been a bit too easy. It would take more than that to keep Thor down. Ready to show the thunder god what she was made of, Gjálp bore down on her pelvis.

She pushed and pushed and pushed as if she was having a bowel movement. Gjálp’s muscles contracted harder than ever before in the giantess’ life. Her bladder attempted to eject every drop of pee all at once. Gjálp’s flow of bodily liquid went from strong to off-the-charts-hissing-like-the-queen-of-waterfalls. Gjálp’s stream was so heavy, she could feel splashback from the growing river splash her legs and her labia. The giantess refused to give in. She continued to push down, attempting to squirt all of her bladder’s weight into Vimur.

Thor and Loki continuously rocked in the waves. The tide was climbing so high, both gods were forced to swim to the surface. Gjálp was pissing so much, the icy waters of Vimur began to boil over and they were even beginning to develop a nice yellow tint to them.

For a master trickster, Loki was terrible in an emergency situation. The god of mischief continued to climb all over Thor like a scared cat would its owner. Thor kept pushing Loki’s hands away from his long, red beard and fixed his eyes on Gjálp’s.

Thor pulled his closed fist back and then swung it forward like he was chucking a baseball. The projectile moved so fast, Gjálp was unable to make it out. It appeared just to be a gray trail of light. It was shooting so fast that the item was on fire like a comet. Gjálp barely had time to flinch before the object vanished beneath her legs and Gjálp felt a sharp twinge of her muscles.

The roar of giantess water stopped. Gjálp’s pee hole was suddenly closed off. There was a prickling sensation from Gjálp’s nethers. No matter how hard Gjálp pushed down and tried to piss, her body refused to spill so much as another drop.

Gjálp’s hands flew across her labia, still dripping with her behemoth micturition. Gjálp finally stumbled upon the problem. After finding her urethral opening, she discovered it was no longer an opening! Stuck inside her piss hole was a large rock. That terrible Thor clogged up her pipes with one swing of a stone! Gjálp wanted to murder the Aesir god! But panic began to fill her noggin.

If Gjálp’s pee hole was clogged, could she ever pee again? Gjálp had managed to release enough fluid in a quite amount of time that this was not a serious issue short term. But in the long run, would she ever be able to pee again? Gjálp knew her bladder was already filling up. It still had a decent weight to it and it was getting fuller by the moment. What if she was unable to remove the stone? Would Gjálp ever be able to drain herself? Would she have to live with the constant pressure? What if her bladder burst?

So many thoughts ran through Gjálp’s skull that the giantess found herself temporarily rigid. Her mind felt as if clouds were blocking it out. Her paranoia took over and insisted that her bladder was much more full than it felt. This new added fear made her need to urinate even more.

As Gjálp stood there, frozen in fear, trying to work with her horrified brain and construct a plan, she hardly even noticed Thor and Loki making it to the opposite end of the river. Thor stuck his iron staff between two branches of a rowan tree on the other side and used it to pull both him and a still freaking-out Loki to safety. The two gods escaped and resumed their journey.

Had Gjálp been in her right state of mind, she would have crushed both gods under toe for such a horrible deed. On the contrary, however, Gjálp’s mental state was out the window. The giantess had no idea where to go from here. How would she ever be able to drain herself again.

Stepping onto one side of the river so she was no longer squatting, Gjálp paced up and down the valley, hoping said movement would inspire her brain. Her fingers were much too large to remove such a blockage. She still couldn’t believe Thor lodged a stone up her pee hole! Jeez, Gjálp has heard of kidney stones, but this was ridiculous! That was it! Normally when a person has trouble urinating, what helps them the most? Having to pee more! Gjálp thought that was how it worked anyway. She could be wrong, but she was desperate and decided to try anything.

Gjálp got onto her hands and knees before the River Vimur. The waters of said river were overflowing onto the icy land. The yellowish river was causing the surrounding ice to melt. Normally Gjálp would be proud of having turned such a cold river into such a warm one. To change the entire climate around a moving body of water… That was impressive. Still, Gjálp knew the river would get cold again. Urine does cool down after a while, after all. Especially with the freezing temperatures of Scandinavia.

Gjálp stared at the flowing river with disgust, knowing full well these were the same waters she just peed in. Desperate to dislodge this stone, she sucked in her courage and began to scoop water out of the river into her cupped hands which she slurped down. Realizing this would take too long, the giantess stuffed her entire face in the river and began to gulp down wave after wave.

After spending much time at the bank of Vimur, Gjálp managed to drink enough fluid to cause the river to retreat almost back to its normal size. Gjálp soon began to feel the added pressure hit her. Her kidneys did their work with efficacy (despite having had to refilter previously urinated pee). Now, the Jötunn had a mountain-sized amount of pressure pressing into her sphincter.

Gjálp quickly squatted again on the river bank and opened up her muscles. This permitted the pee to flow. Gjálp could feel it rush down her pee tube, filling the urethra with hot liquid. Finally, the urine banged against the stone and remained trapped in her body. Not a single drop was able to pass from behind the boulder, holding her bladder prisoner. Gjálp began to get anxious again. Not only was she still unable to pee, but now she drank half a river and her bladder was more full than ever.

Gjálp felt as if an entire planet of water was being held inside her body. She knew this pressure would drive her crazy soon if she couldn’t get it out. Gjálp was tempted to at least try to remove the stone manually. But she was afraid her mammoth-sized fingers would just end up pushing the rock father inside her, making the situation ten times worse.

Gjálp clenched her muscles again, once again restricting the flow. There was still a large amount of urine trapped forever in her urethra. She decided to try again. Gjálp pushed as hard as she could, giving her urine pressure a fighting edge against its battle with Thor’s nasty rock. Gjálp’s urine once again hammered against the stone, but it held its ground. Gjálp did, however, feel a few drops trickle down her legs. This meant it was working, right?

She pulled her urine into a full retreat, holding back the flood before giving in and pushing as hard as she could. Gjálp had no clue if this was how the human body even worked. But she was a giantess, the rules of humanity didn’t apply to her anyway. This was worth a shot. She pushed down, squeezing as tight as she could. Her face broke out into a sweat and her body shook with frustration. She felt as if she was giving birth from her pee hole. Another trickle leaked out, this one stronger than the last.

Damn that Thor! He really wedged it in well. But Gjálp refused to let him win. She would pee! Gjálp tried again. The fourth time’s the charm! She held her piss for a moment, allowing her shaking, sweaty body to take a break. Afterward, she released and allowed pressure to fill her chute. Once again, only a few small drips. Urine had been trapped inside her pee tube for so long, her internal urethra began to burn with irritation. Gjálp knew if she didn’t get this rock removed soon, she would have serious problems on her hand.

Okay, maybe the fifth time’s the charm! Gjálp let her body rest and then bared down once more. She remained squatting, clutching her fists at her side, shaking like a freezing ice giant in labor. Against all odds, the pressure became so great that the stone shot from Gjálp’s body and splashed down into the River Vimur, vanishing below the tide. Following the stone out was a monster gush of boldly fluid.

Gjálp’s breath came out in an exasperated puff of steam. The giantess’ shoulders rolled up. She began to pant worse than a dog in summer. Letting out a weak and slightly miserable moan, Gjálp forced herself to relax and just enjoy the feeling of pissing. A giant wall of urine fled from Gjálp’s sweaty vaginal lips. The jet crashed into the river and once again caused the waters to ripple. Gjálp’s river quickly forced the Vimur River to rise back up. The mighty river again began to overflow towards the top of the banks and spill its contents over the edge, From her position, Gjálp’s pointed toes became doused in her waters, but she didn’t care.

It was a scary feeling being physically unable to pee. But now that it was over, Gjálp wanted to sing to the heavens. She gushed like the world’s worst sea storm. The waters of Vimur bounced all around. Hissing filled Gjálp’s ears and her pressure slowly dropped down.

Gjálp knew she would be here for a while. She was expected back at her father’s place. On the off chance that Thor and Loki escaped - which they now did - Geirrad had a backup plan for murdering them. Something about Gjálp and her sister, Gerip lifting Thor’s chair to the ceiling so he would be crushed between the ceiling and his very own seat. Geirrad’s schemes were always needlessly violent and confusing.

Gjálp knew she needed to leave soon. She still had to beat Thor and Loki back to her father’s place. But this piss felt too damn good to stop! Gjálp refused to stop the flow. Not for all the treasure of the dwarfs. The torrential gush continued to swell up the riverbed and misplace the water already contained. Yellow river water flowed all over. Gjálp just kept up the flow, taking satisfaction in every minute she spent peeing.

After nearly half an hour, Gjálp was nowhere near done urinating. But she knew her father would kill her should she miss his evil plan to murder Thor. So, Gjálp reluctantly wrapped it up. Closing off her stream, she was temporarily satisfied with her partially emptied bladder. Gjálp’s urinary sack was still so full that she had to do a small jig every once in a while, but she should be okay until after Thor was dead. Then, she would have an even more wonderful relief! Maybe her father would let her pee all over Thor’s dead body! That would be a dream come true to drown a deceased Thor in her golden glory.

With these happy thoughts in mind, Gjálp began to skip back home, ready to help her father and sister defeat Thor once and for all.

Hey! I was just wondering if people are still interested in this thread. I have many more stories of gods/goddesses desperate to pee and I am debating whether or not to post them. I don't want to bog down this thread if no one is interested. I worry I am posting too many stories. Just want to know if anyone wants to read more. Thanks in advance! 🙂
