Here is the second story in this series! Enjoy! 🙂

Mike finished helping Jane zip up into her puffy canary yellow dress. The folds of the outfit billowed around Jane’s legs, making it tricky to see where she was going.

“You sure you want to do this again?” Mike asked.

“Yes,” Jane did her very best to hold still for Mike. But with her achingly full bladder, she had no choice but to lift her legs up and down. “I am excited for this!”

“I am too,” Mike grinned. “Just wanted to ask one last time.”

Jane fired her boyfriend a sardonic smile. Once Jane was all zipped up, she began running her hands over her boyfriend’s bare chest. She simpered down at her man’s loincloth and she grinned at his long brown wig. “You are so sexy, my Tarzan!” Jane wailed.

“You are sexy too, my Jane,” Mike grinned.

“Yeah?”

“Yeah…”

The couple kissed. They then looked around at their bedroom. Towels were folded into thirds and fourths all over the floor.

“I’m sorry I am not more comfortable doing this outside,” Mike said, reading his girlfriend’s mind. “Sure, no one is around. We live all the way out in the countryside, I mean… I am just afraid that my neighbors will see.”

“Hey, it’s okay,” Jane said soothingly. “Whatever makes you feel comfortable. If you don’t want to do this outside, that’s perfectly fine, babe! We got towels! We might be in our bedroom, but that’s nothing that a little imagination won’t fix!”

Mike beamed down at his girlfriend. All these years later and Jane’s positive personality never ceased to amaze him.

“Okay,” Mike said. “Remember the safe word?”

“Yoga,” Jane recalled. “Say that and the game stops.” Jane placed on her sun hat and tied it with its sky blue ribbon. “Now, let’s do this!”

Jane looked back on the last time Mike and she did role playing with a full bladder. It was one of the best times of Jane’s life! But Jane had learned from that experience, that when role playing is involved, she must truly get into character. She must have a scene!

Jane told herself that she was not in her bedroom. Rather, she was in a jungle. Gigantic jungle trees were gathered all around, as far as the eye could see. Jane was surrounded by a thicket of some of the tallest trees on earth. There were also gigantic bushes and the most wild flowers she has even laid her English eyes upon.

Jane was no longer Jane… Yes, her name was still Jane no matter which character she played. However, Jane was now an English girl from Great Britain. Jane had gone on an expedition with her father, the acute yet goofy Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, and they were searching for gorillas alongside their protector and guide, the grouchy and violent Clayton. Yet, poor Jane became distracted and ended up getting separated from her father and Clayton. Poor Jane had been wandering the jungle for ages now. And to make matters worse, all that tea she drank had made its way down to her nethers and demanded release.

But Jane was a lady of England. She refused to alleviate her needs anywhere besides the loo or worst case scenario… A lovely chamber pot.

Jane had to stop often and grasp her genitalia through her dress. Jane’s needs had grown in the hours of her wandering aimlessly through the jungle. Jane feared she would not last much longer. She refused to soil her dress! And her poor kickers would get hit full force! No, Jane turned her mind away from these thoughts. She could hold out. At least until she was recused. But alas, Jane hadn’t the foggiest when that would be.

The humin air was causing Jane’s mop of perfectly straightened brown hair to fall from its bun to her face. Jane felt her dress stick to her and could feel her sock covered ankles sweat. Jane simply wished to leave this accursed jungle! How she longed to alleviate herself into a chamber pot! How she yearned to lay down her tired head and rest. But alas, she knew she could not do that here, alone in the jungle. Especially with a urinary bladder ready to burst at the seams should she make an incorrect movement.

Jane was hot and knackered! She wished to return to camp, take a quick tinkle, and go to bed. But unfortunately for poor Jane, she was hopelessly lost and she hadn’t an idea when her suffering would end. How could this expedition get any worse?

Jane stumbled over a tree root. Tripping over her flats, Jane was barely able to steady herself. A particularly nasty wave of desperation washed over Jane. Jane had no choice but to grasp herself through her dress. A heavy moan escaped her lips. Jane reared down, feeling her genitalia through her puffy dress. Her umbrella dropped to the forest floor. Jane moaned, begging her sphincter to remain closed until she hovered her bum above the camp's chamber pot.

Jane heard the screams of monkeys and the buzzing of the humid jungle air. Jane - having regained control - was ready to continue on her way. But suddenly…

A large man with tan skin and piercing blue-green eyes dropped down from the tree tops. This man had a sharp nose, rippling muscles going down his chest, and long flowing brown locks of hair. His features were sharp and his knuckles were covered in fur. Most interestingly about this man was that he was nude. The only clothing he wore was a brown loin cloth around his manhood.

The surprised visit was nearly enough to make poor Jane squirt into her poor, poor kickers!

“Who are you?” Jane demanded, her British accent as stinging the early evening air. Jane kept her hands to her sides, refusing to grab her lady bits as that was most improper of a lady of English such as herself. Jane instead kept her hands to her sides and repeatedly opened and closed her fists. Jane also bent her knees ever so slightly before bringing them back over and over again. These small movements were all Jane could do to keep from weeing all over herself.

Instead of responding via words, the wild man simply held his head high and sniffed at the air. He then looked down at the English girl. Jane could feel his blue-green eyes burn into her. Jane could feel her overfilled bladder quake against her organs.

The Wild Man jumped down from the log he stood upon and now stood directly over Jane. He was nearly a foot taller than the lady from England and he looked much more fierce than any man Jane had ever seen in the British Isles. Jane had to admit… There was something about this man’s rugged nature that she simply found… Appealing. Jane may be a lady from England, but she still had her urges. Of course, Jane would never mention said urges to anyone else. To do so would be considered most improper! Nevertheless, watching this wild man move about the trees as if he owned them… Gazing upon his strong features and his abs… That long hair and those eyes… Even the hairy knuckles… Jane had no doubt that she was smitten. But to love a wild man? That was something else that was simply improper!

Regardless of how she felt, Jane was still lost with a heavy bladder that gnawed at her sphincter, an urge demanding to be recognised. Jane’s bladder - petite like the rest of her - quivered as she stared upon this strange wild man. Fear rushed through the British woman’s head. But despite her fears, Jane was well aware that this man had not yet attacked her, nor did he show any intention of ever doing so. That said, Jane found it best to slowly back away. A wild man like this - dangerous or no - would surely bring with him trouble.

Jane bent to pick up her umbrella. Doing so placed way too much added pressure on poor Jane’s already compulsing bladder. How Jane felt her bladder’s weight hound against her tired sphincter muscle.

“Now just, just back away you wild man,” Jane stammered, backing slowly away, umbrella in hand and her hand resting against the side of her dress. Between the anxiety of being so near this wild man and the throbbing of her bladder, poor Jane was forced to hold her long, skinny legs together and waddle backwards.

The wild man tilted his head and merely snorted.

“Back… Back away…” Jane repeated, backing up farther.

The wild man stood on his feet and his knuckles. He began knuckling walking, stepped forward towards the terrified English lady.

“I said back away!” Jane swung her umbrella.

But the wild man - reflexes quicker than Jane’s country’s most skilled cricket player - held a hand and grasped Jane’s umbrella in his large meaty fist.

Jane hesitated. She released her umbrella and began stumbling backwards. The wild man just stood there in a daze, sniffing the pineapple shaded umbrella.

Jane continued waddling backwards. How she coveted to grab herself and hold as tight as she could for as long as she could. But Jane knew that would be wrong to do in the presence of company. Even company such as this wild man.

The wild man looked up.

“No, no, stay away from me, you wild man,” Jane begged.

The wild man looked down, taking note of Jane’s movements. The wild man looked down at his own body. The wild man then struggled into a standing position. He placed his legs tightly together and began waddling on his feet towards Jane. Mesmerized by the wild man’s sudden change in posture, Jane remained where she was. The wild man stood - once again - right before Jane. The wild man held out the umbrella, handing it back to Jane. Jane stood transfixed, eyes blinking unable to believe such a turn of events.

Jane forced a smile, the corners of her lips moving far upwards, a blush forming over her pale cheeks. “Thank you,” Jane said, slowly accepting the umbrella.

“Thank you,” the wild man said.

Jane winced in alarm. “Did… Did you just speak?”

“Did… Did you just speak?” The wild man repeated.

Jane could not help but smile. “Can… Can you say something else?”

“Can… Can you say something else?”

“No, no… Like… Besides what I say?”

“No, no… Like… Besides what I say?”

“No, no… Can you say…”

“No, no… Can you say…”

Jane moaned. The wild man did the same.

“My name is Jane,” Jane said. “What is yours?”

“My name is Jane,” the wild man said. “What is…”

“No, no,” Jane interrupted. She tapped her chest with her palm. “My name is Jane. What is your name?” Jane pressed down lightly on the wild man’s chest. The wild man stood in shook, gazing down at the strong yet delicate hands on the strange woman. Her very fingers rested on his powerful chest.

The wild man looked up, his blue-green eyes connecting with Jane’s blue ones. “T… Tarzan…” The wild man managed.

Jane stepped back, taken aback. The wild man had actually done it. He spoke in words other than what Jane had said. He was no longer repeating what she said, he was now using his own words. And he had said his name!

“T… Tarzan…” Jane stammered. She smiled. “That… That is a fine name, Tarzan.”

“T… Thank you…” Tarzan said.

Jane was truly amazed! Not only was this wild man capable of speech after all, but he was picking up the idea of talking in words rather quickly.

“W… Where do you come from, Tarzan?” Jane ventured.

Tarzan said one simple word… “Gorillas.”

“Gorillas?” Jane paused, her mouth slowly forming the letter O as the bright English girl connected the dots. Wild man… Gorillas… Knuckle walking… Climbing in the trees so flawlessly… “Were… Were you raised by gorillas?” Jane asked.

Tarzan nodded. “Yes.”

“That is incredible, Tarzan,” Jane said. “My father and I came here to study the gentle creatures. Perhaps you could take us to them sometime.”

Tarzan slowly backed up, the wild man didn’t look too keen on that suggestion. Worrying she might lose her one chance to escape, Jane quickly said, “Just… Just a thought! No pressure of course…” Just using the word ‘pressure’ made Jane grimace as she felt her bladder’s strength against her body. “Tarzan,” Jane said. “I am afraid I have lost my group. Do you think you could help me find my way back?”

Tarzan eyed Jane, looking her up and down. Finally, Tarzan looked back to Jane and nodded.

“Thank you, Tarzan,” Jane said. “I am forever in your debt.”

Mike and Jane took a brief commercial break to set up the next stage of their role playing adventure.

Mike was just finishing laying out a long row of bowls on the floor, each filled to the brim with freezing cold water. Mike also angled the garden hose so it was hanging over the edge of the window, causing water to spray downwards in a fast stream. Just watching all of this moving water made Jane’s bladder ache.

“Better hurry up, Tarzan,” Jane said, placing her hands in her crotch and jumping up and down. “Jane has to peeeee!”

“Well, Jane has to wait,” Mike grinned. “Okay, the bowls are all set up! Back to the game!”

“Mr. Tarzan, do you know where we are going?” Jane asked nervously. “It appears as if we have been walking for a very long time. Are we lost?” Tarzan didn’t respond. He just continued knuckle walking through the jungle.

Jane knew she could not mention her bodily needs, but how she craved a chamber pot. Her urinary bladder was full to bursting. The pressure was getting more powerful and it was near impossible to ignore. Jane had been holding onto her afternoon tea all throughout the evening and she felt ready to pop. But Jane would not dare tell Tarzan this. She did not wish for the wild man - nor any man - to know about her urges - no matter what type of urge it was…

At long last, Tarzan froze. He stood upon his feet and faced a raging river rapidly. Jane felt her bladder lunge. She was confident that a leak would slip out. Thankfully, no such leak emerged from her lady business. But just watching the water rage on, crashing against the sides of the river, bashing against rocks, water splashed all around the edges of the river. Jane was in utter pain and desperation now.

Tarzan turned and faced Jane. “We must cross.”

“Cross!” Jane wailed. “Are you…” Jane - not wishing to offend the wild man - caught herself in time. Jane didn’t think she would have the ability to cross such a strong river under normal circumstances. But with the aching feeling down in her pelvis, she knew this task would be impossible! She certainly could not accomplish it without leaking a little liquid.

Tarzan tilted his head to the side. The wild man appeared confused. It occurred to Jane’s urine filled brain, Tarzan must have grown up in the jungle. To him, crossing a river this strength must have been a daily activity. Tarzan must be deeply confused as to why Jane refused.

“The river is strong,” Jane protested. “I am unsure if I can cross. We don’t do that sort of thing in England!”

Tarzan tilted his head more. He pursed his lips. Tarzan then advanced. Before Jane could even fully understand what was happening, Tarzan wrapped his muscular arms around the small woman and lifted her onto his shoulders.

“Hey!” Jane protected, kicking and clawing at the wild man’s strong shoulders. “Put me down you… You… Wild man!”

Tarzan didn’t appear to even be phased by Jane’s squirming or thrusting. Tarzan simply marched onwards, pushing against the strong current of the ice cold waves. Jane moaned. The ride on Tarzan’s shoulders was unbelievably bumpy. Jane kept bouncing up and down. Icy water splashed her ankles. The ice water felt as if it seeped into Jane’s skin and went directly to her bladder. The freezing water made Jane feel ready to lose control. But she wouldn’t. Especially on Tarzan’s back!

Somehow, Jane managed to keep her hold on her sphincter long enough for a dripping wet Tarzan to place her down on the opposite bank of the river.

Jane was twice as desperate than before that treacherous ride. Jane was no longer able to hold her bladder using sheer will alone. Now, she had to cross her legs tightly. Fortunately, her dress was large enough that she doubted the wild man saw. Or understood for that matter.

“Never… Never do that again!” Jane shouted, slight potty dancing. She thrust her umbrella to point at Tarzan, using her voice to act more intimidating.

Tarzan just looked over the meek Jane Porter, and then walked on.

Tarzan and Jane trudged onwards.

The jungle was hot and sticky and night was fast approaching. Jane felt the pressure form her tiny bladder pulsating against her vulva through her knickers. She knew if she did not reach camp soon, she would make her poor, poor knickers her tempertory chamber pot. The good news was, Tarzan was oblivious to her needs. But Jane half-hoped the wild man would notice her desperate situation on his own. As embarrassing as that would be, perhaps he knew of a rest stop. But no. Jane knew better. They were in the jungle! No rest stop existed anywhere around here.

Finally, they came upon the next obstacle.

Tarzan walked on. Having heard a noise, Jane paused. She looked up in horror. Standing fifty feet in the air, besides the English woman, was an irating waterfall. An entire wave of fifty foot icy water came crashing down all at the exact same moment. The water blazed against the pond’s surface, causing the loudest burbling sound Jane has ever heard. White foam ran down the sides, causing the water to ripple.

Jane’s entire bladder contracted in and out, threatening to explode its contents out and ruin her knickers and her dress all at once.

Watching the falls was far too much for Jane’s miniature bladder to handle. Jane had no choice but to grab her crotch through her dress. Jane grabbed fistfulls of her dress and moaned, bending down to hold on better. Jane’s eyes were glued to the falls. As badly as she wanted to look away, she could not. Her pupils refused to drift away. They were stuck, Jane had zero choice now but to watch and listen to the powerful waterfalls and listen to it influence her bladder to simply release.

Tarzan took note of these strange movements. He spun. “What is wrong?” The wild man asked.

“N… Nothing…” Jane shuffled around, stumbling through her dress. Jane’s legs, crossed too tight, caused her to trip over the fabric of her tight dress. Jane ended up tumbling towards the pond. She felt her bladder pulse and twitch. Her sphincter - in a fit of fear - sent out a very small involuntary leak.

Tarzan lunged forward and grabbed Jane by the waist. He pulled her back to her feet and met her eyes. Once again, the blue-green eyes met the blue.

“What is wrong?” Tarzan repeated.

Staring into the wild man’s eyes, Jane saw how scared he was for her safety. How concerned this stranger was for her. As wild as this man was, he was very kind. He agreed to help Jane for no price, having not even known her. Tarzan - above all else - was a kind man who cared for Jane. It was for this reason, Jane decided to finally reveal her situation to him.

“Well, Tarzan,” Jane said softly. “To… To tell you the truth… I have to… I… I have to…” Jane found Tarzan staring, curiously and cluelessly into her eyes. “I must… Visit the loo… The lavatory…” Jane said. Tarzan’s puzzled look did not fade. If anything, it only appeared to grow. Jane realized with a freight that growing up in the jungle, Tarzan has likely never heard of these things before. Jane feared she would have to be more forceful. “I must…” Jane took a deep breath. “I must urinate… You know… Wee…”

That worked. Tarzan nodded his understanding. He motioned for Jane to follow him. And so she did.

Tarzan led Jane away from the falls and back into the forest. Jane began to panic. Did Tarzan have a plan? Where was he leading her? What did he think of her? Did he find her disturbing for having mentioned her most personal needs?

Tarzan finally came to a stop. There was nothing around except for trees and bushes on all sides. Tarzan faced Jane and motioned her towards a tree.

“Tarzan?” Jane murmured.

Tarzan grunted. He motioned to a bush instead. His body language appeared to be suggesting, ‘You don’t like the tree? How about this bush instead?’

“N… No, Tarzan,” Jane stammered. “It is not the tree, it is, well… Tarzan,” Jane groaned. “I know you do not understand, but… Oh…” Jane stumbled around, holding her legs as tight as possible through her dress. “I am a lady,” Jane said. “A lady of England. We do not do our business… Here! I am sorry, but I cannot…”

Tarzan tilted his head again. “I thought you needed to urinate?”

“I did… I do… Really badly…” Jane reared down and bit her lip. “But I cannot here,” Jane dug her hands so far into her poofy dress that her hands were lost in the sea of yellow fabric.

“Well, I am sorry, Jane,” Tarzan said. “But this is the only way to relieve yourself. I shall do the same.”

Jane paused, slowly soaking in Tarzan’s words. “You must urinate as well?” Jane did her best to keep her voice level. But she could not help but find it amusing that this wild man also needed the exact same thing she did.

Tarzan nodded. Tarzan then turned. Without warning, the wild man lifted his cloth and allowed his penis to hang down. Tarzan’s penis - just like the rest of his body - was large and powerful. Jane couldn’t help but feel her clitoris swell at the very sight of this wild man’s private parts. Without using his hands, Tarzan moved his body, pointing his flaccid penis and a thick trail of steaming yellow liquid fired forth from it.

Watching the wild man relieve himself, watching his stream leave his body and connect with the bark of the tree… To hear the muted hissing sound and to watch the steam rise from the warm stream… Jane felt on the verge of a serious wetting! Lady of England or no, Jane could not keep her liquids inside any longer. She just had to let her tea out!

Jane reached for the zipper of her dress behind her, but to her terror, the zipper did not budge.

“Oh…” Jane stopped her foot over the soft earth under her dress. “The zipper, Tarzan,” Jane moaned. “The zipper is stuck!”

Tarzan - still midstream - looked over his shoulder. “Zipper?” He questioned.

“This!” Jane wailed in agony. “This silver thing behind me! I must pull it down or I cannot alleviate myself! This dress must come off, Tarzan! This dress must come off!”

“Come here,” Tarzan said in a calming voice. “Let me see.”

Jane didn’t know how she felt about standing so near a man who was tending to his call of nature. But Jane wanted to answer nature’s call herself, she had no choice. Jane hobbled over and spun around, her back facing Tarzan. Jane scooped up handfuls of dress, squeezing and holding herself as tight as she could underneath. Jane was too desperate to care what Tarzan thought of her fidgety movements anymore. Back home in England, Jane would have died of embarrassment if anyone had seen. The dance she was currently doing was most improper of a lady. But Jane could not bear the pressure inside her body any longer. Holding her most private area was the only thing allowing her to hold on for even a second longer.

“Hold still,” Tarzan commanded.

“Oh, I am trying, Tarzan,” Jane moaned. “But my needs are too great!”

Penis still pointed at the tree, Tarzan pinched Jane’s zipper with a finger and thumb. With one swift yank of the zipper, Tarzan pulled the silver tool over halfway down. Jane managed to undo the rest.

Jane ripped off her dress, struggling from the weight of the massive thing of cloth, she threw it to a heap on the ground. Jane now stood in shorts and a top. Using language most improper for a lady of England, Jane undid the button and the zipper of her shorts. She pulled them off as well as her top for good measure.

“Don’t look!” Jane thrust a finger at Tarzan.

“Why?” The wild man questioned.

Once again, this was a cultural thing, Jane was sure. Nudity was most certainly no big deal growing up in the jungle. But to Jane…

“Just don’t!” Jane bellowed, in no mood to explain this.

Driven by the forcefulness of Jane’s voice, Tarzan quickly averted his eyes, and focused on his own stream.

Jane stumbled up against the nearest tree. She pulled her knickers off and squatted down, her back pressing against the bark of the tree trunk.

As soon as she was into position, Jane’s body could not wait a moment more. A hot stream of gold blasted from Jane’s lady bits. It came through her urethra and from in between her labia. The strong, warm, slightly smelly stream crashed into the night time grass below her and began to hiss and hiss.

Jane was unable to keep herself from moaning. A relief like this felt incredible! Jane held her head back, letting her skull gently collide with the bark behind her. Jane just moaned, feeling her heavy bladder drain itself in between her feet and into the grass. Jane produced a strong steam which nearly matched the color of her dress.

Tarzan finished. Setting his loincloth back in place - and still refusing to look at Jane - Tarzan stepped to the side, waiting patiently for her.

Jane squatted there for several more moments, feeling the pressure go down little by little as her entire bladder deflated and its contents rushed into the jungle grass at her feet. Jane remained squatting for a very long time before her dinky bladder was fully voided. Jane stood, the full scent of her strong wee wafting into her nose canals. Jane began to get dressed in silence. That is when Jane noticed something that made her stop in her tracks.

“Hey, mister,” Jane shouted. “I said no peeking!”

Tarzan kept his back to Jane, but his head was turned like an owl’s, taking a gander at Jane’s mostly naked body.

“Sorry,” Tarzan turned red and quickly looked away.

Having only one leg inside her shorts, Jane gazed upon Tarzan, her mouth hanging open slightly. Tarzan - while having peaked - was relatively civil for a supposedly wild man. In retrospect, Tarzan appeared more shy than anything. Tarzan grew up in a different lifestyle than Jane did. Tarzan grew up not having to worry about being naked or anything of that nature. Tarzan didn’t understand how that stuff was embarrassing. And yet, he was still respectful of Jane’s wishes. Jane found herself wondering if Tarzan was having the same dirty thoughts about her as she was about him.

“I… I am sorry I yelled,” Jane apologized. “But where I am from, you do not look at a lady when she is dressing or when she is weeing!”

“I apologize, Jane,” Tarzan said in his sexy, manly gruff voice. “It is just that you are highly attractive.”

Jane paused. “You believe so?”

Tarzan nodded. “More attractive than the most gorgeous falls or the most alluring butterfly.”

Jane could not help but smile. For she knew to Tarzan, this was a great compliment. And truthfully, that is how Jane took it as well.

“Umm… Thank you, Tarzan,” Jane said. “You know, it is tough to be prim and proper all the time.”

“I can imagine,” Tarzan said. “I grew up acting, as you say, wild… I could not imagine another lifestyle. Tell me, Jane… Don’t you ever wish for one night, just one night, to be wild and improper?”

Jane thought about this. “Yes,” she said. “Yes, I do…”

“I’m sorry,” Tarzan said, keeping his back to the English woman. “I’ll let you finish getting dressed.”

Jane stared down at her shorts, half on her body. Jane shook her head and kicked off the shorts. Her body was filled with hormones that she was as desperate to release as she had been her urine. “Screw it,” Jane said, before standing, approaching Tarzan, spinning the wild man around, and making out with him.

Mike and Jane lay on the hard carpeted floor, completely naked, and panting heavily, their arms around one another.

“Thank you, Tarzan,” Jane giggled.

“Thank you, Jane!” Mike agreed.

They kissed.

Mike lay his head on Jane’s breasts and Jane smiled. Jane already began to debate about what she and Mike would try next.
