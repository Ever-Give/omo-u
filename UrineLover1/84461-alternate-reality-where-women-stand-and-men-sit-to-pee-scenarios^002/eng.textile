Sorry it has been so long. Between the holiday and personal issues, life has been hectic lately. Enjoy! 🙂

Helena, Melissa, and Angela finished setting up. The rope was lined up across the grassy field and the bowl they set out, sat exactly six meters away.

“Are you sure your neighbors won’t see?” Angela asked, nervousness in her tone.

“I don’t even have neighbors!” Helena wailed. “Well, I mean, I do… But they live far down the road. Unless they are watching us with telescopes, we’ll be okay.”

“What if they are?” Angela cried.

Helena and Melissa let out piercing grunts.

“Will you relax?” Melissa snapped at her sister. “Must you worry about everything?”

“I can’t help it,” Angela protested. “It is the way I am. You can’t stop fear.”

“Maybe not, but there are appropriate times to worry,” Helena explained. “And this is simply not one of them. Trust us, Angel, it is fine.”

Helena and Melissa referred to their younger sister as ‘Angle’ on account of her gorgeous singing voice. They always told Angela that she could become a famous singer someday. Instead, she ended up becoming a real estate agent. But Angela loved her job. Besides, she was far too timid to ever be up on stage.

“Don’t you guys think this is a little… Immature, anyway?” Angela asked. The other two sisters exchanged looks, confused by this question. “I just mean that… We are in our late twenties. Is this game suitable for us?”

“It’s fun! You never outgrow fun,” Melissa protested.

“Yeah, besides, I am curious to see if I am still the best shooter!” Helena cried.

Melissa folded her arms and pursed her lips. “It’s been years, Helena! I think you are out of practice!”

“We’ll just see about that, sis,” Helena spat.

“Can we just get this over with?” Angela snapped. Angela’s two older sisters faced her.

“Angle, this is supposed to be fun,” Helena said. “Not ‘get it over with’.”

“Yeah, something us three sisters could try,” Melissa said. “I mean, like I said, it has been years since we last did this! But it is supposed to be a fun game. If you don’t want to do it, then just go back inside.”

Angela froze. She hated when her sisters left her out of stuff. Of course, they had to leave her out their whole lives. Angela got scared of everything. When they were in high school and Melissa and Helena went to put a fake spider in the principal’s coffee, they left Angela out. When they signed up for Tinder, Angela was scared and refused to do it, so they did without her. When they were young adults and stole their mother’s pornagraphic magazines, they left her out. (Even then, Helena was twenty years old, Melissa nineteen, and Angela eighteen years of age.

So, when their mother found out, Helena and Melissa didn’t even get in trouble. Their mom said they were young ladies now and even went out and bought them more dirty magazines!) There was also the time the sisters were in their early twenties even and decided to urinate in Melissa’s horrible boss’ coffee… They left her out. Angela just got scared of every single thing. And that is the other thing… Whenever Helena and or Melissa do something wrong, they either get away with it entirely or are let off the hook. Maybe Angela really doesn't have a reason to be worried. She understood perfectly well how she could drag her sisters down and they just wanted to have fun. But she still wished they could do something simple together.

But Angela knew they were right. There was no one around for miles. That is why they originally decided to do this activity in Helena’s countryside house. Angela honestly had no reason to be scared. And she knew she didn’t… But she still was.

“I’m sorry,” Angela apologized. “You guys are right. Honestly, I think this would be a lot of fun. But I am just horrified that someone will see.”

“My closest neighbors are over a mile away,” Helena mentioned. “No one has eyesight that impressive!”

“And even if someone does see us, this is Helena’s private property,” Melissa pointed out. “I doubt anyone will get upset about what she does on her own land.”

Angela wasn’t sure about that last point. She knew the society they grew up in declared anything outside one’s own bathroom as public urination. Angela had no issue believing people would say something like, ‘We don’t care if it happened on her own property! Arrest them!’ and they would indeed get arrested. But her sisters did have a point…

“Last chance, Angela, do you want to do this or not?” Helena demanded.

Angela nodded at her oldest sister. “Yeah, I’m in.”

“Good,” Helena replied.

“Excellent!” Melissa clapped. “Okay, who goes first?”

“How about oldest to youngest?” Helena asked.

“So, you go first?” Melissa scoffed.

Helena smiled. “Yeah.”

Melissa and Angela took a step back while Helena took her place in front of the tan ropes.

“Okay,” Melissa said. “We’ll watch and place this black rope down at your farthest distance.” Melissa held three extra ropes. One was black, one was blue, and the third was purple. The sister’s three favorite colors.

“K,” Helena unzipped her pants and moved her underwear to the side. “Watch and learn ladies,” she flipped her braid over her shoulder. “This is how the women pee!”

Instantly, there was a hiss and a golden stream erupted from Helena’s nethers like a golden geyser. The pee stream soared through the flaps of Helena’s jeans, out past the zipper and it sailed across the grassy field.

Melissa and Angela just watched, their eyes transfixed on their older sister’s powerful jet of urine.

Helena’s pee stream touched down into the grass, a few feet shy of the bowl. “Come on,” Helena grunted, forcing her stream to steadily move upwards, inching towards the bowl. Helena stood with her back arched, spreading her lips as wide as possible. Helena cursed. Her stream was nearly at the bowl. Helena’s stream touched down on the inside of the edge of the bowl, just barely making it. Helena cheered. And as soon as she did, her stream slowly retracted as it grew weaker.

Helena’s pee geyser soon came to a slow hault.

“Welp,” Helena unzipped her jeans. “Made it in the bowl! Forget the rope! I made it in the bowl! That is my farthest distance, beat that!”

“Glady,” Melissa smirked, handing Angela the ropes. Melissa stood in front of the center tan rope. “I’m gonna strip my bottom half,” Melissa said, working on taking off her sweatpants. “Easier to aim that way.”

Helena and Angela both just laughed and rolled their eyes. Helena, facing Angela, pointed a thumb at Melissa as if to say, ‘can you believe her?’ It was a known fact among the sisters that Melissa loved peeing naked. But she especially enjoyed peeing naked when she had to aim far away, like now. Melissa has always been one of those women that will pull her pants down entirely at the urinal. Neither Helena or Angela understood this. They always thought peeing their fly was a lot easier and more efficient. But to each their own.

Melissa - ignoring the laughter and eye rolls of her sisters - stood in front of the rope, pants down to her ankles, underwear resting on her knees, shirt lifted up, and fingers on either side of her vulva. Melissa pulled her pink lips as far apart as they would go. She took aim and fired.

Melissa’s stream squirted with more power than Helena’s did. Melissa’s pee stream landed only a couple feet short of the bowl. But unlike Helena’s stream, Melissa’s stream retracted immediately, having less power than before. Melissa began pushing on her pelvic floor, determined to get her stream back to its initial power. All the pushing caused Melissa to release some built up gas, much to the amusement of her sisters. Melissa’s stream gained power, but it refused to go any farther. For the next minute, Melissa’s stream continued to retract and extend across the yard.

It was interesting for Helena and Angela to watch. With Helena’s stream, it simply went forward. But Meliassa’s stream ended up advancing and then retreating. Finally, the stream slowly stopped and a few final drops dripped from Melissa’s privates. Melissa shook off and said, “How did I do?”

Angela went forward. “I believe your farthest distance was here,” Angela lay down the blue rope a couple feet from the bowl.”

“Crap,” Melissa grunted, tying her sweatpants back up. “Didn’t even hit the bowl did I?”

“No,” Helena laughed. “I’m still the best aimer!”

“Hold your horses,” Angela tossed Melissa the two remaining ropes and took her place at the starting line. “I haven’t gone yet.”

“Ohhhh… Think you can beat me, do yeh?” Helena cried.

“I do,” Angela said, pulling her panties to the side and lifting up her skirt.

“Nice to see you getting so involved in this, Angle,” Melissa said.

Angela held her head in an attempt to hide her smile. Angela spread her legs and then used her fingers to spread her lips. She took aim and fired.

Angela’s stream hit the center point of the yard. Exactly halfway between the rope and the bowl. Angela forced her stream to gain power. Angela arched her hips and her stream shot forward. Angela’s stream landed in the bowl, but it did even better than that. Angela’s stream continued progressing beyond the blue floral saucer bowl.

Helena and Melissa stood back, watching in amazement as their sister managed to fire her stream so far, it came only a foot away to the base of a tree on the opposite end of the yard.

Angela continued firing and firing, determined to hit the tree. As soon as Angela’s stream hit the closest root of the old oak tree, it began to retreat. Sadly, Angela was nearly out of ammunition. And that meant she was almost out of power.

Angela’s pee stream retraced its footsteps across the yard, moving back over the bowl and down the length of the giant yard. Angela’s stream ended up directly below her feet. And there it stood for a few seconds more until Angela’s stream died down and was gone.

Angela shook off and then smiled up at her sisters. “Ta-da.”

Melissa applauded. Helena just stood with her mouth hanging wide open. “How… How did you…” Helena managed.

Angela shrugged, lowering her skirt. “I honestly have no idea,” she admitted. “I’m just as proud of myself and just as shocked too!”

Melissa laid the purple rope at Angela’s maximum distance, on the base of the tree. Melissa also brought out the tap measurement and measured all three distances.

Melissa lost at a distance of eighteen feet two inches. Helena came in second with a stream of twenty feet and one-quarter inches. And Angela diffidently won with a stream of thirty-five feet and six inches.

Melissa and Helena were good sports. They each high-fived Angela and Melissa even hugged her.

Helena patted the champion on the shoulder and said, “Pains me to say it, sis… But I suspect you are the best at aiming now.”

Angela smiled. “Guess so,” Angela said modestly.

“And hey, girls,” Melissa said. “I have a second idea for us to try! This one we have never done before either.”

Time for the second contest.

Helena, Melissa, and Angela have been chugging water for the last few hours and all three girls had bladders filled to the very top with hot piss.

Holding their crotches, skipping around, and laughing, the trio danced into Helena’s bathroom.

Helena quickly lifted the seat. “Oldest first,” Helena exclaimed, unzipping her jeans, before her sisters could protest.

“Just once, I’d like it to be youngest first,” Angela complained, kicking her legs out behind her.

“I wouldn’t mind middle child first,” Melissa said, jouncing up and down on her toes with hands digging at her camel toe.

Helena stood in front of the toilet, head leaned back, pussy lips jutting out through the fly. “Ready?”

Holding her lady bits with one hand, Angela held up her cell phone with the other. Angela’s thumb hovered above the start button on her phone’s stopwatch. “Ready,” the youngest sister said.

Helena instantly began gushing into the bowl. The clear toilet water turned a vast shade of yellow. Angela hit the button and began the timer.

“Ahh…” Helena sighed, lowering her shoulders with ease.

All three sisters giggled like three unstable elderly women. Melissa and Angela did insane potty dancing while cracking up. Helena peed into the toilet, unable to breath from all the laughter. Though her giggling, Helena took extra care not to put too much force into this stream. She let it flow out as slowly as she possibly could to give herself added time. But sadly, Helen soon finished. She zipped and stood back.

“My turn…” Melissa potty danced up to the toilet. Melissa quickly undid the draw strings of her sweats and then yanked them all the way down to the floor.

“Again with the pants!” Angela laughed, hands wedged in crotch and taking large steps through the air. Angela set up a second timer and readied her thumb to hit the start button.

“I pee better like this, leave me alone,” Melissa chuckled. A stream shot from deep inside Melissa’s vulva. The stream landed directly in the toilet, sending up a powerful russsh sound. Melissa’s pee was undoubtedly louder than that of Helena’s.

Melissa’s urination ended a few moments later. But it was clear that she was going for an extra lengthy amount of time. Helena and Angela attempted to yell at Melissa about her extra long pee. But all three girls were laughing so much that it was tricky to get the words out.

Melissa lifted her pants and stepped back. Angela handed her phone to a relieved Helena and took Melissa’s place in front of the toilet. Angela planted her feet firmly on the ground, lifted her skirt, moved her panties aside, spread her lips, and she too was off.

Angela’s stream was a lot clearer than that of either Helena or Melissa. This was probably on account of Angela drinking a lot more water than they did. Angela loved to stay hydrated! Angela’s clear piss stream steamed from her lady parts and splashed down in the toilet. Her stream wasn’t nearly as noisy as Melissa’s, but it was messy.

Angela’s stream sent up a lot of splashback. Droplets and dribbles of urine ricocheted off the bowl and fired back at the girls.

“Careful where you’re shooting there, Tex!” Helena laughed, dodging a spray of pee.

“Sorry, I’m messy!” Angela laughed.

“We know,” Melissa said. “Dad always yelled at you for peeing on the seat.”

“And the floor and the wall,” Helena laughed even harder.

Angela’s stream soon finished up.

The results were… Helena lost at a time of two minutes and sixteen seconds. Angela came in second place with a time of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. And Melissa won with a time of five minutes and one second exactly.

“Looks like you just broke five minutes, Melissa!” Angela cried.

“So, I won time and Angel won distance!” Melissa said, regaining control of her breathing.

“Yep, and I didn’t win anything,” Helena pouted.

“I hate to say it girls,” Angela placed her hands firmly on her hips. “But I had a blast today!”

“We knew you would!” Helena clapped Angela on the back again.

Melissa hugged her little sister. “We’re happy you did!” She exclaimed.

“I did,” Angela said. “We should do this more often.” Her sisters laughed. Angela’s smile faded away. “I’m not kidding. Someday, I think I can beat you girls in time too!”
