Sorry it has been so long. Between the holiday and personal issues, life has been hectic lately. Enjoy! 🙂

Helena, Melissa, and Angela finished setting up. The rope was lined up across the grassy field and the bowl they set out, sat exactly six meters away.

“Are you sure your neighbors won’t see?” Angela asked, nervousness in her tone.

“I don’t even have neighbors!” Helena wailed. “Well, I mean, I do… But they live far down the road. Unless they are watching us with telescopes, we’ll be okay.”

“What if they are?” Angela cried.

Helena and Melissa let out piercing grunts.

“Will you relax?” Melissa snapped at her sister. “Must you worry about everything?”

“I can’t help it,” Angela protested. “It is the way I am. You can’t stop fear.”

“Maybe not, but there are appropriate times to worry,” Helena explained. “And this is simply not one of them. Trust us, Angel, it is fine.”

Helena and Melissa referred to their younger sister as ‘Angle’ on account of her gorgeous singing voice. They always told Angela that she could become a famous singer someday. Instead, she ended up becoming a real estate agent. But Angela loved her job. Besides, she was far too timid to ever be up on stage.

“Don’t you guys think this is a little… Immature, anyway?” Angela asked. The other two sisters exchanged looks, confused by this question. “I just mean that… We are in our late twenties. Is this game suitable for us?”

“It’s fun! You never outgrow fun,” Melissa protested.

“Yeah, besides, I am curious to see if I am still the best shooter!” Helena cried.

Melissa folded her arms and pursed her lips. “It’s been years, Helena! I think you are out of practice!”

“We’ll just see about that, sis,” Helena spat.

“Can we just get this over with?” Angela snapped. Angela’s two older sisters faced her.

“Angle, this is supposed to be fun,” Helena said. “Not ‘get it over with’.”

“Yeah, something us three sisters could try,” Melissa said. “I mean, like I said, it has been years since we last did this! But it is supposed to be a fun game. If you don’t want to do it, then just go back inside.”

Angela froze. She hated when her sisters left her out of stuff. Of course, they had to leave her out their whole lives. Angela got scared of everything. When they were in high school and Melissa and Helena went to put a fake spider in the principal’s coffee, they left Angela out. When they signed up for Tinder, Angela was scared and refused to do it, so they did without her. When they were young adults and stole their mother’s pornagraphic magazines, they left her out. (Even then, Helena was twenty years old, Melissa nineteen, and Angela eighteen years of age.

So, when their mother found out, Helena and Melissa didn’t even get in trouble. Their mom said they were young ladies now and even went out and bought them more dirty magazines!) There was also the time the sisters were in their early twenties even and decided to urinate in Melissa’s horrible boss’ coffee… They left her out. Angela just got scared of every single thing. And that is the other thing… Whenever Helena and or Melissa do something wrong, they either get away with it entirely or are let off the hook. Maybe Angela really doesn't have a reason to be worried. She understood perfectly well how she could drag her sisters down and they just wanted to have fun. But she still wished they could do something simple together.

But Angela knew they were right. There was no one around for miles. That is why they originally decided to do this activity in Helena’s countryside house. Angela honestly had no reason to be scared. And she knew she didn’t… But she still was.

“I’m sorry,” Angela apologized. “You guys are right. Honestly, I think this would be a lot of fun. But I am just horrified that someone will see.”

“My closest neighbors are over a mile away,” Helena mentioned. “No one has eyesight that impressive!”

“And even if someone does see us, this is Helena’s private property,” Melissa pointed out. “I doubt anyone will get upset about what she does on her own land.”

Angela wasn’t sure about that last point. She knew the society they grew up in declared anything outside one’s own bathroom as public urination. Angela had no issue believing people would say something like, ‘We don’t care if it happened on her own property! Arrest them!’ and they would indeed get arrested. But her sisters did have a point…

“Last chance, Angela, do you want to do this or not?” Helena demanded.

Angela nodded at her oldest sister. “Yeah, I’m in.”

“Good,” Helena replied.

“Excellent!” Melissa clapped. “Okay, who goes first?”

“How about oldest to youngest?” Helena asked.

“So, you go first?” Melissa scoffed.

Helena smiled. “Yeah.”

Melissa and Angela took a step back while Helena took her place in front of the tan ropes.

“Okay,” Melissa said. “We’ll watch and place this black rope down at your farthest distance.” Melissa held three extra ropes. One was black, one was blue, and the third was purple. The sister’s three favorite colors.

“K,” Helena unzipped her pants and moved her underwear to the side. “Watch and learn ladies,” she flipped her braid over her shoulder. “This is how the women pee!”

Instantly, there was a hiss and a golden stream erupted from Helena’s nethers like a golden geyser. The pee stream soared through the flaps of Helena’s jeans, out past the zipper and it sailed across the grassy field.

Melissa and Angela just watched, their eyes transfixed on their older sister’s powerful jet of urine.

Helena’s pee stream touched down into the grass, a few feet shy of the bowl. “Come on,” Helena grunted, forcing her stream to steadily move upwards, inching towards the bowl. Helena stood with her back arched, spreading her lips as wide as possible. Helena cursed. Her stream was nearly at the bowl. Helena’s stream touched down on the inside of the edge of the bowl, just barely making it. Helena cheered. And as soon as she did, her stream slowly retracted as it grew weaker.

Helena’s pee geyser soon came to a slow hault.

“Welp,” Helena unzipped her jeans. “Made it in the bowl! Forget the rope! I made it in the bowl! That is my farthest distance, beat that!”

“Glady,” Melissa smirked, handing Angela the ropes. Melissa stood in front of the center tan rope. “I’m gonna strip my bottom half,” Melissa said, working on taking off her sweatpants. “Easier to aim that way.”

Helena and Angela both just laughed and rolled their eyes. Helena, facing Angela, pointed a thumb at Melissa as if to say, ‘can you believe her?’ It was a known fact among the sisters that Melissa loved peeing naked. But she especially enjoyed peeing naked when she had to aim far away, like now. Melissa has always been one of those women that will pull her pants down entirely at the urinal. Neither Helena or Angela understood this. They always thought peeing their fly was a lot easier and more efficient. But to each their own.

Melissa - ignoring the laughter and eye rolls of her sisters - stood in front of the rope, pants down to her ankles, underwear resting on her knees, shirt lifted up, and fingers on either side of her vulva. Melissa pulled her pink lips as far apart as they would go. She took aim and fired.

Melissa’s stream squirted with more power than Helena’s did. Melissa’s pee stream landed only a couple feet short of the bowl. But unlike Helena’s stream, Melissa’s stream retracted immediately, having less power than before. Melissa began pushing on her pelvic floor, determined to get her stream back to its initial power. All the pushing caused Melissa to release some built up gas, much to the amusement of her sisters. Melissa’s stream gained power, but it refused to go any farther. For the next minute, Melissa’s stream continued to retract and extend across the yard.

It was interesting for Helena and Angela to watch. With Helena’s stream, it simply went forward. But Meliassa’s stream ended up advancing and then retreating. Finally, the stream slowly stopped and a few final drops dripped from Melissa’s privates. Melissa shook off and said, “How did I do?”

Angela went forward. “I believe your farthest distance was here,” Angela lay down the blue rope a couple feet from the bowl.”

“Crap,” Melissa grunted, tying her sweatpants back up. “Didn’t even hit the bowl did I?”

“No,” Helena laughed. “I’m still the best aimer!”

“Hold your horses,” Angela tossed Melissa the two remaining ropes and took her place at the starting line. “I haven’t gone yet.”

“Ohhhh… Think you can beat me, do yeh?” Helena cried.

“I do,” Angela said, pulling her panties to the side and lifting up her skirt.

“Nice to see you getting so involved in this, Angle,” Melissa said.

Angela held her head in an attempt to hide her smile. Angela spread her legs and then used her fingers to spread her lips. She took aim and fired.

Angela’s stream hit the center point of the yard. Exactly halfway between the rope and the bowl. Angela forced her stream to gain power. Angela arched her hips and her stream shot forward. Angela’s stream landed in the bowl, but it did even better than that. Angela’s stream continued progressing beyond the blue floral saucer bowl.

Helena and Melissa stood back, watching in amazement as their sister managed to fire her stream so far, it came only a foot away to the base of a tree on the opposite end of the yard.

Angela continued firing and firing, determined to hit the tree. As soon as Angela’s stream hit the closest root of the old oak tree, it began to retreat. Sadly, Angela was nearly out of ammunition. And that meant she was almost out of power.

Angela’s pee stream retraced its footsteps across the yard, moving back over the bowl and down the length of the giant yard. Angela’s stream ended up directly below her feet. And there it stood for a few seconds more until Angela’s stream died down and was gone.

Angela shook off and then smiled up at her sisters. “Ta-da.”

Melissa applauded. Helena just stood with her mouth hanging wide open. “How… How did you…” Helena managed.

Angela shrugged, lowering her skirt. “I honestly have no idea,” she admitted. “I’m just as proud of myself and just as shocked too!”

Melissa laid the purple rope at Angela’s maximum distance, on the base of the tree. Melissa also brought out the tap measurement and measured all three distances.

Melissa lost at a distance of eighteen feet two inches. Helena came in second with a stream of twenty feet and one-quarter inches. And Angela diffidently won with a stream of thirty-five feet and six inches.

Melissa and Helena were good sports. They each high-fived Angela and Melissa even hugged her.

Helena patted the champion on the shoulder and said, “Pains me to say it, sis… But I suspect you are the best at aiming now.”

Angela smiled. “Guess so,” Angela said modestly.

“And hey, girls,” Melissa said. “I have a second idea for us to try! This one we have never done before either.”

Time for the second contest.

Helena, Melissa, and Angela have been chugging water for the last few hours and all three girls had bladders filled to the very top with hot piss.

Holding their crotches, skipping around, and laughing, the trio danced into Helena’s bathroom.

Helena quickly lifted the seat. “Oldest first,” Helena exclaimed, unzipping her jeans, before her sisters could protest.

“Just once, I’d like it to be youngest first,” Angela complained, kicking her legs out behind her.

“I wouldn’t mind middle child first,” Melissa said, jouncing up and down on her toes with hands digging at her camel toe.

Helena stood in front of the toilet, head leaned back, pussy lips jutting out through the fly. “Ready?”

Holding her lady bits with one hand, Angela held up her cell phone with the other. Angela’s thumb hovered above the start button on her phone’s stopwatch. “Ready,” the youngest sister said.

Helena instantly began gushing into the bowl. The clear toilet water turned a vast shade of yellow. Angela hit the button and began the timer.

“Ahh…” Helena sighed, lowering her shoulders with ease.

All three sisters giggled like three unstable elderly women. Melissa and Angela did insane potty dancing while cracking up. Helena peed into the toilet, unable to breath from all the laughter. Though her giggling, Helena took extra care not to put too much force into this stream. She let it flow out as slowly as she possibly could to give herself added time. But sadly, Helen soon finished. She zipped and stood back.

“My turn…” Melissa potty danced up to the toilet. Melissa quickly undid the draw strings of her sweats and then yanked them all the way down to the floor.

“Again with the pants!” Angela laughed, hands wedged in crotch and taking large steps through the air. Angela set up a second timer and readied her thumb to hit the start button.

“I pee better like this, leave me alone,” Melissa chuckled. A stream shot from deep inside Melissa’s vulva. The stream landed directly in the toilet, sending up a powerful russsh sound. Melissa’s pee was undoubtedly louder than that of Helena’s.

Melissa’s urination ended a few moments later. But it was clear that she was going for an extra lengthy amount of time. Helena and Angela attempted to yell at Melissa about her extra long pee. But all three girls were laughing so much that it was tricky to get the words out.

Melissa lifted her pants and stepped back. Angela handed her phone to a relieved Helena and took Melissa’s place in front of the toilet. Angela planted her feet firmly on the ground, lifted her skirt, moved her panties aside, spread her lips, and she too was off.

Angela’s stream was a lot clearer than that of either Helena or Melissa. This was probably on account of Angela drinking a lot more water than they did. Angela loved to stay hydrated! Angela’s clear piss stream steamed from her lady parts and splashed down in the toilet. Her stream wasn’t nearly as noisy as Melissa’s, but it was messy.

Angela’s stream sent up a lot of splashback. Droplets and dribbles of urine ricocheted off the bowl and fired back at the girls.

“Careful where you’re shooting there, Tex!” Helena laughed, dodging a spray of pee.

“Sorry, I’m messy!” Angela laughed.

“We know,” Melissa said. “Dad always yelled at you for peeing on the seat.”

“And the floor and the wall,” Helena laughed even harder.

Angela’s stream soon finished up.

The results were… Helena lost at a time of two minutes and sixteen seconds. Angela came in second place with a time of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. And Melissa won with a time of five minutes and one second exactly.

“Looks like you just broke five minutes, Melissa!” Angela cried.

“So, I won time and Angel won distance!” Melissa said, regaining control of her breathing.

“Yep, and I didn’t win anything,” Helena pouted.

“I hate to say it girls,” Angela placed her hands firmly on her hips. “But I had a blast today!”

“We knew you would!” Helena clapped Angela on the back again.

Melissa hugged her little sister. “We’re happy you did!” She exclaimed.

“I did,” Angela said. “We should do this more often.” Her sisters laughed. Angela’s smile faded away. “I’m not kidding. Someday, I think I can beat you girls in time too!”

Here is the next scenario! Enjoy!

Paige sped her car down the road, ignoring several traffic laws. Paige had her legs crossed tightly in her seat, and keeping only one hand on the wheel, she kept the other firmly in her the fabric of her skirt.

Paige was beginning to wish she had peed before leaving after all. Why did her boss have to call her into work today? Out of all the days she could have been called into work, why today! Paige was pretty sure her boss hated her. No, Paige knew full well that her boss had no idea what she was doing today. Paige was just looking for someone to blame. Anyway, it was her own fault for not deciding just to end the game and go pee.

Her friends insisted they may not be able to last until she got out of work. And Paige was starting to think she wouldn’t either. Her five hour shift hadn't even started yet and she was already dancing in her seat. Maybe when she stood up, it would be easier to hold. Or it might be worse, come to think of it. After all, Paige stood to pee. If anything, crammed into her car for a ten minute drive might be the easiest part of her day!

Paige of course could just pee at work, her friends would never know! But Paige was not a cheater and her friends all knew that. They also knew that Paige was very competitive and wanted to win this silly game. They knew she would push herself to her very limit. At home, that was one thing, but at work…

No, no, Paige could hold it. She would show her friends how tough her bladder was! She would win this pee holding contest! Even if her friends didn’t spend the actual game with her…

Paige’s friends all told her before she left that they should just end the game and pee. Paige was furious with her boss for calling her up and interrupting their game! But apparently, they had many customers today and so Paige's day off was considered irrelevant! Refusing to give up, however, Paige told her friends they should just keep holding and they could continue the game when she got back. Her friends all insisted they would not last the five hours she was gone. Paige just smiled at them and had said, ‘So, that means, I’ll win?’

Perhaps Paige should have listened after all. Here she was, squirming in her seat on her way to work. Maybe she wouldn’t be able to make it after all? No, no she would! But either way, was this game really that fun without her girl friends? Maybe not, but Paige would still win whether she was there with them or not!

Still, all of that water she drank for the contest was doing a number on her sphincter. Paige had downed two liters of water in an hour and it wanted to get out of her body ASAP! Paige felt those two liters shift around inside of her on each bump she hit. Her seatbelt was crushing the life out of her already miserable bladder. Paige felt as if a vast ocean was pressing down on her urinary sphincter muscle. The pressure was too much to bear. Paige was close to peeing right here in her car. How would she last for another five hours?

Paige’s car zoomed into the nearest parking space. Paige fled from her car and charged through the restaurant doors. Paige now stood, half potty dancing, in the front of a Red Robin restaurant. Paige still couldn’t believe even with a Bachelor's degree, she was still a waitress. She would have to find a better job one of these days. But as for today, she would wait tables and try not to burst.

But upon taking a closer survey of her bladder, Paige feared that she might not make it five hours after all. Paige hated losing! But her friends were desperate to pee when she left. They might have lost already. Despite her hatred of losing, Paige would not cheat and she would not lie to her friends. If she did use the bathroom, she would have to tell them about it. Worst of all, Paige feared having a public accident in front of her co-workers and or the customers. Paige would have to pee!

And so, hoping her friends had already lost the contest, Paige grabbed her uniform off of the rack, held her genitals through her silky bubble gum colored skirt, and began hobbling at a quick pace towards the ladies' room.

Paige was nearly at the door when she heard a call from her boss.

“Paige, thank goodness you are here!” Roy the manager called.

Paige spun. “Roy?”

“As you can see here, Paige,” Roy said. “We are jam packed with customers today!” Paige had been so caught up in her desperate need that she hadn’t even taken the time to consider the layout of the restaurant. Nearly every table was filled with customers. This was the most busy Paige has seen this place in months. “Sorry to have to call you in on your day off. Paige,” Roy apologized. “But truthfully, I am not sure we would have been able to handle this without you. I hate it, but I had to call in many employees today.”

“It’s fine,” Paige managed, hoping this conversation was nearly over.

“Hey,” Roy looked back at her. “Why are you heading towards the bathroom? You can just slip your apron on here. Not like you need to change!”

It was true. All Paige had to do was put her apron on. Paige wanted to tell her boss that she needed to use the restroom. Roy was a super understanding guy! He would have understood immediately. Paige also wasn’t shy. She wasn’t one of those people who got embarrassed to ask for a bathroom. But Paige decided against telling her boss her needs. Not because she was afraid of his reaction or embarrassed to do so, but she realized this was a good motivation to hold on. Paige probably wouldn’t make it her entire five hour shift. She knew that. But she also knew her friends wouldn’t either! Paige’s friends looked ready to burst by the time Paige left. She couldn’t imagine how they were doing now. But if they hadn’t peed yet, then Paige didn’t want to either. While Paige still feared a public accident, it was a good incentive to hold.

And so Paige - doing her hardest not to fidget - told her boss, “You’re right, I can just put it on right here.” Keeping her legs together, Paige slipped on her apron and tied it behind her.

“There yeh go!” Roy chanted. “Not get to work! As usual, I’ll be around if you need anything.” Roy walked off.

Keeping her legs pressed together under her apron, Paige did a penguin waddle towards her first table.

The good news was, working definitely took Paige’s mind off of her need. But the bad news was, having to move around so much was only making her need worse. And having to juggle many plates while keeping her knees together was tough. The worst was when Paige had to bring her customers some water or any beverage for that matter. Just watching all the liquid bounce around in the glass made Paige’s bladder ready to explode.

While working, Paige got several texts from her friends. Each text told Paige that one of them had lost control and peed. Most of them made it to the toilet - but poor Jenna had an accident! Between tables, Paige texted her friends saying that she was still going strong. This was a bit of a fib. Paige’s bladder hurt and Paige could do absolutely nothing to ease the pressure. And having to walk around while juggling plates and worse drinks, made Paige ready to join Jenna in the accident club! But Paige would not back down!

Paige was unsure if the customers were able to pick up on her urge. For the most part, Paige did a great job of standing still and not dancing around. Several times, however, she did have to subtly grab her crotch. If anyone noticed, they didn’t comment on it. And even then, Paige honestly wasn’t too embarrassed to do the potty dance in front of people. She wanted to try and help it if she could, but it also won’t be the worst thing. Paige mostly feared her boss finding out she was desperate. If Roy knew, he would force her to take a break and Paige would lose this game. But from the looks of things, she just had to hang in a little bit longer.

The second hour of Paige’s shift had ended. Two hours down, three to go. At this point, the urge was the strongest Paige had ever felt it. She could no longer keep still even for a moment. Her hands had found a new home in her apron. Paige knew that eventually, people would catch on and Roy would make her take a much needed urinal break. The urinal would be awesome to use right now! Just the thought of that skinny wall toilet sent tingles up Paige’s bladder. She could do this! She had to outlast her friends! Paige’s ego would not allow her to lose… But her sphincter might.

Finally, at long, long last, Paige got a text saying that the last of her friends, Jessie, gave up and used the bathroom.

Paige quickly began texting, one hand on her phone, the other against her bladder. ‘Looks like I win! GG girls!’ Paige texted back. Paige then stuffed her cell phone in the pocket of her apron and made a sprint towards the ladies’ room.

Paige was almost there! She could feel her hands on the wooden door when…

“Hey, Paige,” called Ameila, one of Paige’s co-workers. Paige turned to face her, her eyes wide and her face red. “Mind covering for me while I take a smoke break?” Ameila asked.

Paige placed her hands in her crotch and jumped from foot to foot with her knees arched out to the sides. “Sorry, Ameila,” Paige said. “But I really need to use the urinal!” Paige danced and danced as a way to prove her point.

“And I need a smoke break!” Ameila snapped. “I can’t take one more minute with these idiotic customers without a smoke!”

Paige squeezed her leg to her thigh, keeping her hands wedged up her skirt. “Maybe you should try to quit,” Paige offered.

“Maybe you should try and hold your piss like a big girl,” Ameila shot back. “Come on, I’ll smoke and you help out the restaurant.”

“Right now, I want a restroom!” Paige emphasized.

Ameila scowled at her. “Cover for me or I am telling Jack that you love him!”

Paige froze up. Jack was Paige’s other co-worker. Paige has had the biggest crush on Jack for years, ever since she got this dumb job. Jack made working here not so bad. Jack was the guy that checked off all the boxes! Kind and caring? Check. Smart? Check. Funny? Double check. Fun to be around? You know it! Cute. Extremely! The thing was, Paige was a super outgoing person. Paige was the literally opposite of shy! She could talk to anyone about anything. But when it comes to cute guys… She became the biggest dunce in the world!

Paige would rather die than tell the man she likes how she feels. Paige may not find it embarrassing to have to pee super, but having the guy she likes know how she feels… That would be humiliating!

“Okay, okay, you win,” Paige said, crossing her legs and bouncing. “Go and take your damn smoke break!”

“Thanks, girl,” Ameila gave her a playful wink and rushed off.

“But when will you come back!” Paige called, but Ameila was gone.

Bladder full and bathroom break gone, Paige returned to waiting tables.

It felt like time was going backwards.

Paige’s bladder hurt so bad. Paige felt the water up to her eyes. All that water she drank was pounding down on her sphincter, all two liters of it! Paige was ready to pop! Paige feared that in some time, she would pee, urinal or no. She would just lose control and pee herself. That would be embarrassing enough, but if Jack in particular saw… Paige would have to move to Mexico and change her name! She had to keep holding!

Paige’s hand fumbled around her notepad, struggling to take down a customer’s order. Paige stomped her foot under her. She kept her knees tied together. ‘Come on, Ameila, where are you?’ Paige begged.

After placing in the order, Paige picked up a large tray with several plates of food. Paige was halfway to dropping the food off at the appropriate table.

“Ma’am,” one of her customer’s called. The lady finished slurping down her lemonade. The sound went straight from Paige’s ear canal all the way down to her bladder. Watching the yellow drink disappear made Paige eager to fill it back up with her own yellow liquid! “Can I get a refill?” The woman asked.

“Uh…” Paige managed, eyes fixated on the now empty glass, watching the melting ice with temptation.

Then suddenly, a sudden urge hit Paige. It was the strongest wave of desperation yet. Paige knew she was about ready to pee. In a desperate panic, without thinking, Paige threw down the black tray and grasped herself. This was a terrible move to make in terms of sociology. But Paige knew if she didn’t grab herself, urine would squirt right out into her panties and dribble to the floor.

Burgers, steak, fries, and onion rings flew onto the floor. Plates shattered and cracked. Barbeque sauce spilled. All heads turned to face Paige. Paige knew they were watching because she spilled the food. She knew they were watching because she was doing the potty dance. Paige felt a quick trickle escape her smoldering pee hole. Her undies were definitely moist now. However, no pee leaked out… Yet.

Roy came rushing over. “Paige,” he said, his voice a mix of anger and concern. “What’s the problem here?”

“Roy… I’m sorry!” Paige broke down, tears steaming her cheeks. “I have to piss so bad! But Ameila took her break and I have to cover for her and I…”

“Okay, okay,” Roy held up his hands in an attempt to slow his employees’ speech down. “Use the bathroom, I’ll get someone to clean this up.”

Paige was ready to breathe a breath of excitement. “Oh god, thank you!” Without further ado, Paige rounded on her heels and made haste to the ladies’ room.

Paige charged into the restroom. Just seeing the urinal was enough to make Paige squirt again. The bathroom was empty except for one lady in the stall and judging by the sounds coming from the stall, she was emptying more than just her bladder.

Paige dashed up to the urinal as quick as the Flash himself. Paige instantly yanked up her apron and her skirt, she pulled her panties to the side and…

“Ahhhhhhhhhhh…” Paige let out a long moan, her lips twitched into a smile, her eyes relaxed, the redness in her skin let up. Paige allowed her head to fall forward and she lightly placed her head on the wall.

Paige lay with her head on the wall, her fingers holding up her clothing and keeping her lips spread. Paige looked down and watched her yellow river hose down the taffy colored urinal cake. Paige allowed her eyes to drift shut. Paige just stood there, feet spread, head against the wall, eyes closed, skirt and apron raised, panties aside, vaginal lips spread, and a wide river between her legs, much more relaxed than a moment ago.

It felt astonishing to allow all the pressure to drain from her pelvis. Paige just adored the feeling of having those two liters of water leave her body. Paige was so relaxed that she let some gas slip from her backdoor, but she didn’t care at all. This felt sooo incredible!

Paige heard footsteps. She looked to see a customer walk up to the urinal next to Paige. Paige didn’t really care for another woman peeing right next to her, but seeing as how this bathroom only had two urinals, the other woman clearly had no choice.

The woman spread her legs, opened her fly, puffed air from her mouth, and peed onto her own urinal cake. Paige couldn’t help but look. She quickly looked away and sighed.

“Feeling better?” The woman asked. Her tone suggested that she understood how much pain Paige had been in before.

“Much,” Paige sighed.”‘How did you know I was so desperate?”

“Your face says it all,” the woman replied. “That is the look of a lady desperate to tinkle!” The woman laughed. “Plus, I saw your whole potty dancing routine out there.”

“You did?” Paige groaned. “I’m so embarrassed!”

“Ah, don’t be embarrassed!” The woman cried. “We all get desperate at times! Besides, the mess is being cleaned up right now. No harm, no foul.”

“Thanks,” Paige forced a smile.

“Oh, man!” The woman moaned. Paige’s bathroom companion released her hands from her jeans and instead placed both of her hands firmly on the wall in front of her.

Paige smirked. “No hands?”

“Nope!” The woman grinned. “No hands! And check this out!” The woman began wiggling her hips and shuffling her feet slightly. Paige watched as the woman made clear lines and slashes in the urinal bowl with her pee. “Z… O… E… Y,” the woman spelled out slowly. “Zoey! That’s my name!”

“Too bad the pee doesn’t leave any marks,” Paige mused. “Sucks you can’t actually spell out your name in the urinal. Unlike the snow that is.”

“Yeah, but it’s still fun to do, even if it doesn’t leave any permediant marks,” Zoey said.

“Well, coming from the woman that cleans this heer ladies’ room… That’s probably for the best,” Paige laughed. Zoey laughed too. “But hey, watch this,” Paige stood upright and began moving her own hips and torso. “P… A… I… G… E…” Paige spelled out her own name. “Paige.”

“Hey, Paige, nice to meet you,” Zoey extended her hand.

Paige took one hand off of her vulva to shake it. “Likewise, Zoey.”

“May I ask how you became so desperate?” Zoey asked. “Just out of general curiosity.”

“Oh, actually, I originally had the day off today,” Paige explained. “Me and my friends were having a holding contest, you know, where we hold in our pee…”

“Sure, sure.”

“Well, apparently the restaurant got busy and so my boss called me in,” Paige went on. “I was determined to still beat my friends, so I held all of my shift so far. My friends finally texted saying they had all lost and peed. So, I went to pee. But then my damn coworker wanted to smoke and left me to cover for her.”

Zoey exhaled. “That sucks.”

“Yeah…”

“But at least you get relief now though, right?” Zoey pointed out.

“You know it, girl!” Paige cried. Zoey laughed.

Their conversation was cut short by the sound of a toilet flushing. The woman in the stall exited and washed her hands before leaving the washroom.

A moment later, Zoey’s stream stopped. Zoey redid her pants. She then made a fist and slammed it down over the flusher. Paige watched as water filled up Zoey’s urinal and her golden lake was carried down the pipes.

“See yeh,” Zoey said.

“See yeh,” Paige agreed.

Zoey hiked up her pants and then left the bathroom. Paige peed for several more moments, taking her time to drain all of the water from her system. When Paige’s bladder was satisfied, Paige flushed her urinal - which was about to spill from all Paige’s pee. As she watched the urinal flush, Paige rearranged her underwear and allowed her skirt and apron to drop. Paige bent down and spent a moment clearing the wrinkles from her apron. Paige - being an employee that handed the food - washed her hands well with soap and water and soon returned to her shift.

Thankfully, no one was angry with Paige for spilling the food. No one even cared that she broke the plates. No one spoke of what happened, and Paige was grateful for that. She was also grateful to learn that while Paige had her little… Incident… Jack, too, had been in the bathroom, so he had no idea what happened. Upon noticing the half cleaned up mess, Jack asked what happened. Roy was very vague and just told him there was a spill. No one was angry at Paige and Jack had no clue what had happened. Things were turning out to be okay. Although, that may just be contentment of having a freshly drained bladder.

Paige finished up her shift and went home where her friends were waiting. Paige told them they could hang out at her house - where they had been when Paige was called in - until she was done with work.

Paige announced to her friends that she won their contest. Between Paige having a large bladder and they all having small bladders (plus Paige’s competitive streak) they didn’t doubt it. Paige was the bladder queen! Despite not being here, she won the contest!

Paige also shared with her friends everything that happened while holding at work. Plus the woman she met in the restroom, Zoey. Paige’s friends laughed at all of her stories.

“This was fun,” Paige told her friends. “We should have another bladder match next week!”

Story number five:

Lauren slumped at the dining hall table. Emily sat beside her, rubbing her back. Emily and Lauren’s two roommates, Francesca and Mila were with them. Francesca - being sixty years old - was reading a newspaper and Mila - close to fifty years old - was busy knitting a scarf. Emily and Lauren were both juniors and they had the luck of being placed in the same room as two rather elderly women. But they didn’t mind too much. Francesca and Mila were pretty cool for their age.

“I can’t believe Professor Gamett failed me on that paper…” Lauren stammered. ‘I worked so hard…”

“I know, Lauren,” Emily said. “It sucks. It makes no sense at all.”

“Makes no sense why that guy is such a grouch, period,” Francesca said. “I have overheard him shout and scream at his fellow co-workers. Just the other day, he shouted at the English professor telling him that English is the easiest subject and he wasted his life studying it. Professor Gamett’s just a mean little man who likes to put down and belittle others for his own amusement.”

Emily pursed her lips. “I once heard that he called a student out for not knowing the answers to some tough questions. He made her cry.”

“I once heard he tore up a student’s notes, complaining that the handwriting was too sloppy,” Mila put in.

“And the paper was on how to reduce carbon footprint too,” Lauren sighed. “I’m a whiz at that stuff!” It was true. No one had a lower carbon footprint than Lauren!

“Speaking of,” Mila looked up from her knitting. “Back in my day, if a professor failed you or someone hurt you, know what you did?”

Emily shifted an eye roll. “If it involves whiz, can’t wait to know,” Emily spoke sarcastically.

Emily and Lauren crept through the dark halls of the college’s science center. They finally made it to Professor Gamett’s classroom where Emily processed in picking the lock.

“Are we sure we should be doing this?” Lauren asked nervously. “Perhaps Professor Gamett only failed me to motivate me to work harder!”

Emily slowly looked up at her red haired friend. Emily loved Lauren beyond belief, she couldn’t ask for a better friend… But Lauren was such a goody-goody! She actually believed good things come to those who deserve them and bad people will be punished. That kind of thinking will get her far in the real world. The worst part was, Lauren had her hands on her hips and said this foolish statement with such confidence. Poor injudicious girl.

Emily decided against even responding to this insane comment. Emily pushed open the door and stood. The two women entered the dark classroom.

“This seems wrong,” Lauren said.

“Just keep watch.”

“We could get into trouble.”

“I know, that’s why I asked you to keep watch.” Emily slithered over to the stack of textbooks on a shelf in the corner.

“Emily,” Lauren called. “That is college property! Those don’t even belong to Professor…”

“Yeah, but how foolish will he look if they are destroyed on his watch. Same goes for almost everything in here!” Emily cried.

Emily stood with her back to Lauren, unzipped her fly, and sprayed. A golden stream showered over the pile of textbooks, dampening the pages and soaking the covers. Emily soon stopped and zipped up.

“Gotta save some,” Emily said. “A lot of work to do! All clear?”

Lauren peeked down the dark hall. “Yeah, all good.”

Emily’s next target was the shelves upon shelves of science tools. The beam balance, the bunsen burners, the microscopes, the hot plates, the vortexes, things Emily couldn’t even name. It was all about to get a golden shower. Emily lowered her zipper and sprinkled her juices all over the fancy equipment. Emily then zipped and made her way over to target number three.

“Still good?” Emily asked.

Lauren once again checked down the hall. “Yeah.”

Emily stood in front of Professor Gamett’s chair, undid her jeans, and drizzled hot liquid onto the wooden seat. “Man,” Emily smirked as she pissed. “I wish I could see the guy’s face when he sits on this tomorrow! Man! I wish he had his laptop here! But I’ll bet he took it home.”

Lauren couldn’t help but smile. It was nice to imagine this guy’s expression when he discovered his whole classroom covered in piss come morning. Just imagine him sitting on this chair in the morning! Emily did appear to be having quite a bit of fun. Lauren knew that Professor Gamett wasn’t just hard on her, he was hard on everyone. No one ever got an A in his class. Most students were lucky to get a B. Professor Gamett was also kind of rude. Not to Lauren, but if a student didn’t know the answer to a question, he would roll his eyes or smash his head against the wall, looking super annoyed. Maybe he did need to be put in his place. Lauren reconsidered her friend’s words regarding the laptop.

“He keeps a spare in the back,” Lauren mentioned.

Emily glanced over her shoulder. She quickly zipped and followed Lauren into the back of the classroom. Planted on a desk was a sleek black laptop.

“Man, looks expensive…” Emily grinned.

“One day, I tried to ask him a question after class,” Lauren mentioned. “He was just on this laptop and pretended he couldn’t hear me. He then grabbed his other laptop and left this one here.”

“Nice work, Lauren! See, you’re getting into it!” Emily clapped Lauren on the back.

“Yeah, but this does look expensive. I feel so bad,”

“Don’t. This guy is a rotten man who deserves it!” Emily unzipped and gushed all over the shining black piece of equipment.

Lauren wandered towards the front of the classroom. She recalled all the times Professor Gamett made students cry, and the times he hollered at students and even his fellow staff members.

Lauren stood before Professor Gamett’s whiteboard and she found herself unzipping her jeans and holding her vaginal lips apart. “Hey, Emily,” Lauren called. “Check this out!” Lauren sprayed her hot urine all over the whiteboard.

“Nice, Lauren!” Emily cried.

Lauren moved her hips around, writing a brief massage on the whiteboard with her pee. While her urine slid down the board, it certainly left marks and streaks. The message, while sloppy, was clearly visible. ‘Stop torturing others, you jerk!"

“You jerk?” Emily muttered. “Wait to dig deep there, Lauren.”

“I thought it was pretty good,” Lauren zipped.

They heard a noise from down the hall. There was a flashlight moving towards them.

“Lauren, you were supposed to keep watch,” Emily hissed.

Lauren turned pale. She had never gotten into trouble in her whole life. What would happen when she was caught! Would she be expelled? Put into prison? Lauren’s heart raced, her fingers and toes grew numb. Lauren’s eyes widened and her breathing slowed. Fear crawled at her brain, making it impossible for Lauren to concentrate on the acute situation she now found herself in.

Fortunately for Lauren, her friend has been into rough circumstances like this before and she knew exactly what to do.

Lauren and Emily hid in the closet, their elbows digging into each other’s collar bones, their feet crushing their companion’s, they breath all over one another.

Emily was able to hear Lauren’s heartbeat. It was indeed speedy! Emily was half afraid Lauren would have a heart attack right here, only inches away from her.

The closet was dark and cramped. Science equipment dug into their shoulders and pricked them on the back. At long last, the footsteps grew away.

Emily slowly opened the door and looked down the hall. When the coast was clear, the two girls slowly made their way out of the closet, through the quiet classroom, and down the hall.

“Well, that was an experience!” Emily cried as the duo raced across the grass.

“Sure was,” Lauren said. “But I am kind of glad we did it!”

“Me too!” Emily agreed. “You know, Lauren, I must say, I quite enjoy seeing this side of you!”

“What side?”

“You know… The crazy, evil side.”

“What? I’m not crazy… Or evil!”

“Sure,” Emily laughed.

“But I do think we should do this again!” Lauren exclaimed.

Emily nearly tripped over her shoes. “Come again? You, Lauren, want to get in trouble again?”

“Yeah, I liked sneaking around with you and spraying our pee all over Professor Gamett’s property!” Lauren cried. “Didn’t you?”

Not even having to stop and think about the question, Emily said, “I did. But who should we attack next?”

“I’m thinking…” Lauren paused before saying, “Anyone who tries and hurts the earth!”

Emily laughed. So, Lauren may have a slight evil side now, but she was still goody-two-shoes, saving the world self!
