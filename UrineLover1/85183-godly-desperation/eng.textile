Godly Desperation

I am a huge fan of mythology, particularly Greek. So, I decided to write a story where some of the ancient Greek goddesses are desperate to urinate. There is a little talk of sex and obviously urine in this story. So do not read if you are uncomfortable. Hope you enjoy! 🙂

PS, this was a time before underwear was invented, so for story purposes, all of the characters in this story will be going commando. Enjoy!

Athena charged through the halls, her strong hands pressed tightly below her war skirt. Athena was simply overcome with joy that no one was around to witness her dilemma. The wisdom goddess would simply be humiliated beyond belief if anyone saw her like this. Athena also knew that several of the gods would like to see her like this!

Particularly gods like Hephestus, who she knew was deeply in love with her. There were also her rivals like Poseidon, Ares, and Aphrodite who would all get their sick kicks from seeing Athena like this. But no one was around now, and Athena was relieved. Speaking of relief…

The wisdom goddess’ sandals slapped the floor repetitively as her strong yet shaky legs led her closer and closer to the restrooms of Mount Olympus.

As she ran, Athena cursed herself. She is the wisdom goddess! Why on earth did she have so many drinks! She blamed Dionysus! The guy threw such excellent parties that even the most strict, work oriented gods could not help but relax. Athena had over two barrels of wine. That would kill a mortal! But Athena was a divine goddess. She was above the mortals. Their rules of living did not apply to her. Likewise, it is the only reason Athena has managed to contain this much alcohol for so long.

Athena - being an immortal, all powerful Greek goddess - was able to hold back tremendous amounts of liquid. The gods - while they do urinate like mortals - are able to hold nearly one thousand times as much and for a thousand times as long. With that said, even gods do have their limits, just as the mortals do. And Athena was nearing hers.

Not only did these two barrels of wine make Athena’s bladder ache with desperation, however, the wisdom goddess has not visited the facilities in over two weeks. Athena has been far too busy leading her armies to victory and giving men wisdom when they needed it the most.

Last night, Athena had been ready to use the washroom, but she heard from Hermes that the hero, Perseus, was in dire need of assistance. Perseus was on a quest to slay the monster, Medusa, the very monster Athena, herself created. Perseus had the location of the gorgon’s lair as well as a magical sack to stuff her head in and winged shoes (both gifts of Hermes). Athena had decided to put her bladder’s needs aside and she went down to earth to give the hero a hand in his journey. Athena presented Perseus with a sharp sword to slice off Medusa’s head as well as a crystal clear shield to look at Medusa in, as a way of not looking at the monster directly.

After Athena and Perseus parted ways and Athena returned home, she was too exhausted to use the restroom and instead went to bed. In the morning, Athena’s urge was worse than it has been in centuries! The wisdom goddess could not remember the last time she strayed so far from a restroom visit. But, she reluctantly did her daily work and in the evening, attended Dionysus’ celebration.

At long last, Athena spotted the restroom. But the sight that awaited Athena made the wisdom goddess ready to break down into tears. Before the doorway to the goddess’ room, there was a long line.

Standing in front of the line was Hera. Hera kept her legs tightly crossed and was bent over with her back erect. Hera kept one hand wedged far up her dress and she used the other to relentlessly bang on the bathroom door.

Next in line was Aphrodite. Aphrodite was busy dancing all over the place. The love goddess kept her knee together and was constantly bouncing on her heels. She was grabbing herself, but she looked like she desperately wanted to.

Behind Aphrodite was Demeter. The desperate goddess of agriculture kept her scythe wedged between her legs as a way to hold, and was constantly bouncing up and down. How Demeter didn’t stab herself with her own weapon, Athena had no idea.

Behind Demeter was Artemis. Artemis kept her legs crossed and was shuffling from foot to foot. Artemis grabbed at the crotch of her robes rather often, the silver charms on her wrists clattering as she moved her hand around. The quiver of arrows on the moon goddess’ back were quite literally quivering from all of her movements.

Behind Artemis was Hestia. The goddess of the hearth was kneeling on the floor, her hands wedged so far into her robes, they appeared to have vanished. Hestia’s eyes were shut and tears were streaming down her face. Her whole body trembled from the pain of a full bladder.

The final goddess in line was Persephone. The flower goddess kept her legs crossed and her toes pointed outwards. Her hands were busy fiddling with a necklace of pomegranate seeds around her neck as a way to distract herself from her urgent need of release.

Athena took her place in line behind Persephone. Six other goddesses were in line! Six? Athena was number seventh to relieve herself? But from the looks of things, all of these other goddesses were in similar situations to Athena. Given how large and strong a god’s bladder is, it was rare to see one desperate god in any given place. Let alone seven!

“What is the hold up?” Athena snapped, bouncing like a ball. “I must attend to my biological needs!”

“Yeah,” Persephone growled, tapping her toes against the floor. “We all do!”

“Eris is in there,” Demeter glanced back at Athena. “She is all pissed that we didn’t invite her to this party and so she sealed herself in the bathroom so we can’t get in.”

This was one of the stupidest things Athena has ever heard of. And she has Ares for a brother! “This is not our party, it is Dionysus’,” Athena snapped. “He refused to invite her and truthfully, I do not blame him in the slightest!”

“Okay, Eris, you made your point,” Hera banged on the door harder. “Now let us in!”

No response. Eris was so petty! Athena would not be surprised if someday Eris decided to start a war in retaliation for being excluded from events like this.

“OPEN UP ERIS!” Hera bellowed, rambing on the door with her fist.

“There are no other bathrooms available?” Athena snapped.

“Poseidon got upset about something earlier,” Aphrodite explained. “And he accidentally caused all of the other bathrooms to flood.”

Of course he did! Athena would kill that sea god later. Right now… She needed to pee!

“Wait a moment,” Athena said. “We are goddesses! We have powers! Why not just bust in?”

“Hephestus made these walls and these doors so indestructible that they don’t even break under the influence of our powers,” Hera explained.

“And a good thing too,” Artemis admitted. “Imagine if the gods could destroy these walls? Mount Olympus would go down so fast!”

Athena knew she was right. If the gods had the ability to destroy Mount Olympus… They would. Not intentionally, of course. But the gods as a race have a tendency to be quite destructive, even when they don’t mean to be.

Hestia continued to sob loudly on the floor, squeezing herself and grunting. “Guys… I can’t hold much longer…” Hestia moaned. “I have a tiny bladder…”

“Yeah, but you mean a tiny bladder for a god right?” Artemis marched in place while gripping her nether regions.

“Well… Yeah…” Hestia said.

“So, your bladder is smaller than the rest of us, sure, but it is still larger than mortals!” Artemis pointed out. “It will be okay.”

“Just try and keep holding, Hestia,” Demeter encouraged her sister.

“GET OUT ERIS!” Hera hammered on the door. “THERE ARE ABOUT TO BE ACCIDENTS OUT HERE!”

Hestia sobbed. “I… I can’t last much longer…”

Something suddenly clicked into Athena’s mind. “Why are you guys so desperate to go anyway? We have godly bladders! Why the urgency?”

“Same as you,” Aphrodite replied. “None of us have pissed in days! I was too busy jumping around from lover to lover.”

“Gross,” Artemis made a gagging noise. “No one wants to hear that!”

“Well, unlike you Aphrodite,” Demeter scowled. “I have been doing some real work! The crops don’t grow themselves you know!”

“And I’ve been busy hunting with my girls in the wilderness,” Artemis said. “We took down many beasts.”

“I have been so busy giving countless heroes wisdom, I have forsaken my bladder for quite some time,” Athena mentioned.

“Same,” Persephone moaned, holding one leg up to her crotch. “Queen of the Underworld is a full time job, you know.”

“Are you still with Death Breath?” Demeter mocked, ahead in line.

“Mother!” Persephone wailed. “His name is Hades! And he is the god I love! He treats me well!”

“Blah, blah, blah,” Demeter used her hand to indicate her daughter was speaking too much by rapidly moving her fingers up and down from her thumb.

Persephone rolled her eyes. “Whatever, I am far too desperate to argue with you right now. Speaking of, mind if I cut in line? It is getting extra urgent!”

“No!” Aphrodite snapped.

“Wait your turn,” Artemis growled.

“And anyway,” Demeter said. “If anyone has a right to cut in line, it is Hestia!”

But Hestia being so kind and sweet, even while shaking and sweating, she shook her head and simply said, “No, I’m okay. I can wait… I think… I hope… Maybe not… I have to go…”

“Just try and hold a little bit longer, Hestia,” Artemis moaned.

“ERIS, GET OUT!!” Hera bellowed, her fist a blur of light as it smashed against the marble door at full force. “AS YOUR QUEEN AND YOUR MOTHER, I COMMAND YOU TO OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW YOUNG LADY!!!” Hera’s voice was so loud that it rocketed across the halls of Olympus. Hera’s booming queenly roar was so powerful that it sent shockwaves into the bladders of all the desperate goddesses.

“Move,” Aphrodite angrily pushed Hera aside and began lightly knocking on the door. “Eris,” Aphrodite shifted her weight, her hand wedged in between her thighs. Aphrodite’s dress was lifted up, showing the goddesses behind her, her lovely buttocks. But knowing Aphrodite, she wouldn’t have been all that upset with this outcome. “Eris,” Aphrodite moaned again.

“If you come out and let us in, I shall present you with the most handsome man in all of Greece!”

“That is never going to…” Hera began.

The door cracked open ever so slightly. The face of discord was hidden underneath its shadows. “How handsome?” Eris asked.

“The handsomest lad you have ever laid your eyes upon,” Aphrodite promised.

Eris stared to the ground, thinking long and hard. She finally looked up and replied, “I don’t do serious relationships, men have a tendency to hate me.”

“Okay, a one-time fling! I can do that!” Aphrodite said.

“Nah, I was thinking more… A friend with benefits,” Eris said.

“Done and done,” Aphrodite said, waddling in place, hands pressed as far up against her vulva as they could go.

“But make him assertive,” Eris said. “I don’t do push overs either.”

“Assertive friend with benefits,” Aphrodite said through grit teeth. “Anything else?”

Eris thought. “I want him to be into strange stuff. Normal sex is boring to me.”

“Assertive friend with benefits, strange sex stuff,” Aphrodite let out a desperate wail as she fought down the strongest wave of desperation yet. “Anything else?”

Eris though. “I think that should about do it. Oh, and make sure he hates you guys as much as I do!”

“Yes, yes, and yes!” Aphrodite wailed. “Now MOVE!!!”

“Come on, Eris,” Artemis moaned.

“Get out of the way!” Persephone cried.

“I’m going to pee!” Demeter shouted.

“Leave now, Eris, please…” Athena begged.

“Fine,” Eris flew the door open and walked off.

Hera faced Aphrodite, bewilderment across her face. “Seriously?”

Aphrodite shrugged. “The power of love… Or in this case meaningless sex… Conquers all!”

“And you couldn’t have done that half an hour ago!” Hera snapped.

“WHO CARES! LET US PEE!” Artemis shouted.

Hera and Aphrodite, still facing one another, turned and shoved past one another, crawling over each other, clawing at each other’s side, fighting and fighting to be the first one into the open bathroom.

“It is because of me that Eris came out,” Aphrodite snapped.

“I don’t care!” Hera shouted. “I have to pee! Besides, I was here first!”

“Too bad, so sad!” The love goddess retorted.

Eventually, Aphrodite pushed past Hera and slammed the door shut.

“Damn it, Aphrodite!” Hera wailed, returning her hands to their position in between her legs. Hera bounced and squirmed, her swollen bladder hurt against her ribs. Hera wanted to destroy something. How dare Eris keep them waiting for so long! How dare Aphrodite cut in front of her in line! She was the queen of Olympus. Did no one care about her bladder’s needs?

The downside to having godly bladders, was that the gods and goddesses had a tendency to take extra-long bathroom breaks. Especially if they have been holding for a long time. That is why gods take few bathroom breaks in the first place! Gods know that their bladders are extra-large and that makes them pee for a long time. So, gods will often put it off, so they don’t have to abandon their work for several minutes. But again, the problem there is the longer they wait, the longer they pee.

The good news was that the original problem was solved, and Eris was now out of the rest room. The bad news, however, was that their situation was only half over. The goddesses all knew full well that this line would move extra slowly. And given how long the goddesses have waited to pee, they may be stuck in this line for hours while each and every one of them takes their turn at draining her massive bladder.

And they were right to be worried. Ten long minutes passed by and still no Aphrodite.

Hera ramed on the door again. “Hey, Aphrodite! Get out! You fall in?”

“I’ve been holding since last week!” Aphrodite shouted from the other side of the door.

“And I’ve been holding for two!” Athena snapped. “And here I am at the back of the line with gallons and gallons of water, wine, beer, and milk all swirling inside. Now get out, Love Girl!”

“Please…” Hestia moaned on the floor.

“I’m gonna need a few,” Aphrodite said. “Keep your toga on out there!”

“We have already given you ten!” Demeter snapped. “Ten long minutes! Now get out!”

“And our togas need to come off right now so we can piss!” Artemis shouted. Artemis squatted down slightly, pressed her knees closer together. “Times like this, I wish I was mortal,” Artemis moaned.

The others looked at the moon goddess in supreme confusion.

“The mortals have tiny bladders…” Hera said. “Even smaller than Hestia, sorry Hestia… Why would you wish to be one of them?”

“While it is true the mortals have tiny bladders,” Artemis explained. “Mortals have public latrines. They have long benches with holes in them. These places are so large that they allow a great number of mortals to alleviate their needs.”

“Really?” Hera asked in shock.

“How many is a great number?” Demeter wondered.

“Usually about twenty some mortals,” Artemis said. The other goddesses gasped and awed at the moon goddess’ words. As the goddess of the hunt, Artemis spent more time on earth than pretty much any other god or goddess. So naturally, Artemis knew things about the mortal world that the other goddesses didn’t.

“Why don’t we have that?” Athena demanded.

“Well, the thing with public latrines is,” Artemis went on. “Well… They are public! This is absolutely no privacy. Everyone will watch you pee and or defecate. Public latrines are used by the general public. That is to say, royalty like kings, queens, princes, and princesses have private toilet chambers inside their home. The public latrine is for the public to use.”

“Well, we gods are the utmost royalty!” Athena said. The others all muttered in agreement.

“Plus, I can’t pee with others watching. Not even my husband,” Persephone crossed her legs in front of her, and in doing so almost fell over. She managed to steady her footing. “I have a ridiculously shy bladder,” the queen of the underworld stated.

“I’m sure you could pee in front of me,” Demeter said, bending over and squeezed her knees with her fists. “I am your mother.”

“I can’t go in front of anyone! That includes you!” Persephone cried.

Demeter looked ready to argue.

Hestia jumped in and quickly said, “May we please not talk about this…” Hestia rolled her legs over so she was sitting entirely on the ground. Hestia hugged her knees to her crotch. The goddess of the hearth was sweating bullets. Hestia’s face resembled a gladiator. It was all twisted and sweaty as if she had just finished running a mile or fighting a giant.

“Hestia is correct,” Athena grabbed herself under her skirt, not caring who saw. “Talking about this will only make our current need worsen.”

And so silence fell over the goddess bathroom line.

Soon, the queen of Olympus once again lost her patience and began banging on the door, shouting at the love goddess to exit so she may enter. A moment later, the door opened. And there stood Aphrodite. Aphrodite smiled sweetly, looking a whole lot healer than when she had entered the bathroom. Aphrodite looked relieved and at peace with the world. Athena noticed something else.

“Aphrodite… were you wearing make-up before entering the restroom?”

“Huh? Oh, no,” the love goddess replied. “I applied it while I was there.”

“YOU SPENT TIME ON YOUR MAKE-UP WHILE WE WERE BURSTING TO PISS!!!” Hera bellowed with absolute rage.

“I also did my hair,” Aphrodite flipped her strawberry blonde hair. “You ladies like?”

Hera’s face was twisted in rage. Hera chewed her lip, her eyes large, her features bent and out of shape. Hera kept her hands in her crotch and kept stumbling around as if she were a drunk mortal. Hera bellowed a fit of curses at Aphrodite for keeping them waiting while she did her hair and make-up.

“Hera! Just please pee and be done with it!” Hestia shouted, desperation creeping along the edges of the hearth goddess’ voice. Hestia is by far the most peaceful of the Olympians. Hearing Hestia yell is as rare as a blue moon. But that just means when Hestia does yell, the rest of the gods take her seriously.

Hera eyed her elder sister with sorrow. Hera may have a temper, but she, just like everyone else, hated seeing Hestia unhappy. Hera was almost tempted to let Hestia cut in front of her, but Hera would not give the satisfaction to Hestia nor anyone else of knowing she would put them above herself. Hera was a queen after all! She had to act like it!

Hera instead simply eyed Aphrodite with a ‘I’ll deal with you later’ look, Hera then faced the open bathroom, shouted, “Time to take a piss fit for a queen!” And Hera charged into the bathroom, slamming the metal door behind her.

Aphrodite smiled at the others, wished them luck, and then walked off.

Artemis looked behind her shoulder at a struggling Hestia. “You can cut in front of me, Hestia,” Artemis said. “I can wait.”

“Yeah, me too,” Demeter said.

But once again, the kind hearth goddess would not disadvantage others for her own needs. “I am okay,” Hestia lied. “Trust me, I can wait.”

“I’m not sure if you can,” Artemis admitted, eyeing Hestia struggling. “You can cut, Hestia, it is okay, really.”

“No, no, I shall wait my turn,” Hestia said. Hestia said this, but the fullness inside her bladder was saying otherwise. Hestia felt her sphincter fail her, just for a split second. Hestia felt warmth roll down her legs and soak the insides of her robes. Moaning, Hestia squeezed herself extra tightly. She would not like her family to know how urgent her need truly was. Hestia was all about family. Family always has, did, and always will come first in her mind. If anything, Hestia should step out of line and allow Persephone and Athena to take their much needed relief before her. And any other day, Hestia would have as well. But truthfully, Hestia may not make it until Demeter and artemis are done, let alone Persephone and Athena too. But she had to try. But Hestai felt her tiny bladder shrivel. Her sphincter had grown tired in the days Hestia refused to empty her bladder.

Hestia felt as if her urinary sphincter was the titan Atlas, forced to hold up the entire weight of the sky and keep it from crushing the world. For the first time since Atlas was punished in the events following the Titanomachy - war between the gods and the titans - Hestia had sympathy for poor Atlas. Was this how the poor titan always felt? Having to hold up the pressure of the entire sky single handedly, knowing if he faulted, even for a second, he would be the first to be crushed under the sky’s massive weight. This realization was enough to almost make Hestia want to free the titan from his imprisonment. But she also knew how sinister he was. He had served as her father, Kronos’ right hand man in the war.

Hestia suddenly had another thought… Kronos, her father… He ate his children. As soon as they were born, Kronos ingested Hestia along with her sisters, Demeter and Hera as well as her brothers, Hades and Poseidon. (Zeus got away, but that’s another story). But Hestia suddenly realized… When a mother is expecting her child, she has to pee a lot and very urgently. Did Hestia’s father go through the same thing? Having five godly children inside his stomach surely had its consequences. Maybe Kronos developed bladder problems in that time. The stomach may be relatively far away from the bladder, but having five gods press down on your stomach may have also affected other organs like the intestines, lungs… The bladder.

Hestia silently cursed herself. Here she was yelling at her family for talking about the restroom, and she was doing the exact same. Hestia just needed to relax and try to focus on something else. Yet, no matter where the hearth goddess’ mind went, her thoughts always returned to her bladder.

Hera sure was taking her sweet time in the goddess’ room.

Aside from poor small bladdered Hestia, Artemis had it the far worse. Artemis would not tell the others about this - partly due to the fact it was unladylike to speak of her urge but also, she did not want them thinking she was weak - but the fact of the matter was, Artemis was holding more liquids than any other goddess in this line.

Just last week, Artemis’ hunters asked the moon goddess to engage in a water drinking contest with them. Artemis was happy to comply. Artemis originally assumed it would be a contest where they all drank at once. But she came to learn that it would be one on one. The winner of each contest would go on and challenge another hunter until they won.

And so, Artemis - being an all powerful goddess - was easily able to drink more than any other hunter in her ranks. Artemis gulped down an entire barrel of water before her competitors were even able to take a sip. And after Artemis beat each huntress, she challenged another and another and another. Artemis - having won the contest - was forced to drink against each hunter. Needless to say, she became desperate for relief quickly. Artemis spent the next week always trying, but failing to take that relief. It was always something!

A huntress needed her, a monster attacked, a woman claimed her children were more attractive than her and her brother… Being the goddess of the hunt and moon is a lot of work! Artemis did not have time to engage in a silly thing like relieve her bladder. Artemis has always found that very concept ridiculous! Especially for a goddess! She should have no need to alleviate herself like the mortals do. It is a waste of time! When Prometheus sculpted humans, he clearly gave them a lot of strange features. Like a need to pee. Why not allow them to use all the liquid they drink? Wouldn't that have been more efficient? No wonder Zeus chained up Prometheus with an eagle to peek out his liver once daily.

Bottom line, Artemis has drunk down several barrels of water and has not peed in a week! While peeing may be a ridiculous concept, it is currently a very urgent one to Artemis. How artemis regreted coming to this party! But she knew she had to. Dionysus threw this party in the first place to cheer up his wife, Ariadna. It has been five years today that Ariadna’s first love, Theseus broke up with her and abandoned her on a deserted island. Artemis had become good friends with Ariadna and wanted to help cheer her up. Still, Artemis wished she had the chance to pee before returning to Olympus.

Hera has been busy in the restroom for a long time now. Again, not uncommon for a god to take an extended period of time in the restroom after a long hold and many drinks. But having to wait on the opposite side of the door was infuriating!

“How long has she been in there?’ Demeter stood on one leg, the other laced tightly around the first.

“I don’t know,” Athena bent over, grabbing at her lady parts with all of her might.

“If she is doing her make-up too, I am going to kill her!” Persephone snapped.

“You can’t kill a goddess,” Athena warned. “Especially the queen of Olympus.”

“A figure of speech, Owl Head,” Persephone shot back.

“Watch it, Pomegranate Seed!” Athena countered.

“Oh, go turn a girl into a spider!” Persephone snapped.

“She had it coming, she challenged me!”

“I know, no one should ever challenge Granny to a knitting contest!”

Athena’s mouth dropped, anger bubbling on her skit. “It was a waving content!”

“What in Tartarus’ name is the difference?” The queen of the underworld spat.

“Well, at least I don’t eat the first piece of food I see! Especially in the underworld! Have you no control?”

“Have you no husband?”

Athena leapt back in alarm. “That is a personal choice! And if I did have a husband, I certainly would not settle for the king of the dead!”

“Told you,” Demeter called from the front of the line.

“Hades treats me well,” Persephone snapped. “The guy quite literally bent the laws of nature and grew flowers in the underworld just for me!”

“Oh…” Athena began her retaliation, but Hestia jumped in once more.

“Please stop you guys,” Hestia cried. “I am in so much pain! My bladder feels like it is about to burst! I do not wish to listen to your fighting along with that!”

“Sorry, Hestia,” Athena apologized.

“Yeah, sorry,” Persephone agreed.

Demeter reached down and squeezed herself, causing her grass colored dress to bunch up under her. “I desperately need to water the crops, if you know what I mean,” Demeter managed.

“Yeah, we all do,” Athena hissed.

“Come on, Hera…” Hestia moaned, tears flooding her eyes as her hands grew tired at her genitalia and her knees trembled with numbness.

Moments passed. Still no Hera.

Demeter leaned on her scythe, her hands wedged in between her thighs. Demeter swayed on her feet similar to a flower in the breeze. Artemis was leaning her back against the wall while keeping her hands firmly under her skirt. Artemis’ legs trembled as if they could no longer hold her weight. Hestia lay in a fetal position on the ground, hands deep in crotch, moaning and sobbing from extreme pain. Persephone had abandoned trying to distract herself with her necklace and was now simply grabbing hold of herself while hopping front foot to foot, keeping her knees closed tightly together. Athena, meanwhile, had her legs wrapped with her toes pointed to the sky. Athena held her hands on the top of her legs, and squeezed her eyes shut, attempting to visualize herself somewhere else.

Finally, Artemis began tapping her foot against the ground at a rapid pace. She kept her arms to her side, holding herself with just her sphincter muscles. Athemis’ breathing was heavy. Artemis drank way too much water and she felt the first trickle make its way out. Artemis was well aware of a little bit of her pee rolling down her legs and falling to the marble floor. “I can’t take this anymore!” Artemis’ hands shot into her crotch and she turned and began waddling away.

“Where are you going?” Athena demanded.

“Down to earth!” Artemis shouted.

“Why?” Persephone demanded.

“Why do you think? To pee!” Artemis cried. The goddesses still looked confused. “I am going to the forest to pee in nature!” Artemis shouted.

The others looked disgusted.

“Have you no shame?” Athena cried.

“My shame is this close to rolling down my leg!” Artemis held up a finger and thumb only centimeters away. “Anyone care to join me? Hestia? You look desperate.”

“I…” Hestia noticed the other goddesses staring at her. Under normal circumstances, Hestia would have gladly taken this offer. But she again feared what her family would think. ‘“I’m okay here,” Hestia promised.

“Fine,” before the group of desperate goddesses, Artemis shapeshifted into a bright blue eagle. The blue eagle took flight and flew off of Olympus, down to the mortal world to get her huntress’ bursting bladder some relief.

A few moments after Artemis fled, the bathroom door opened, and Demeter went rushing in. “I have to piss like a mule on the racetrack!” Demeter wailed, slamming the door.

“Took you long enough,” Athena snapped.

“Don’t push me Weavier,” Hera warned. “Where is Artemis?’

“Went down to earth to pee,” Persephone caught Hera up.

“That is disgusting!” Hera bellowed. “What is wrong with her?”

“She had to pee, and Artemis - unlike us - is outdoorsy. I’ll bet she does this all the time,” Hestia told the others, excusing Artemis’ actions.

Hera just rolled her eyes and left.

“And then there were three,” Persephone narrated.

Persephone was correct. While Demeter took her relief, this left three ancient Greek goddesses outside the door, struggling to stay dry.

Hestia sat in front of the door, desperately staring at it like a puppy waiting to be let out. Hestia sat upright with her knees to her chest and her body shaking with urge. Persephone stood directly behind Hestia. Persephone spent her desperate moments crossing her legs in front of each other and moving them back. Persephone’s legs took turns being the dominant leg to hold back the ever growing flood inside the queen on the underworld’s bladder. This left Athena at the end of the line grabbing at herself and bunching up her scarlet war skirt.

“Damn, I need to piss…” Persephone said under her breath.

“Come on, Demeter,” Hestia whimpered, begging the door to open as she rocked back and forth on her butt.

Hestia refused to acknowledge the bulge that was rapidly growing from her stomach. Hetsia’s bladder was bulged out so far, she had no idea how she could possibly stand back up. Hestia’s whole body hurt. Her bladder quaked with anticipation, knowing she was next in line to empty herself. Hestia knew the upcoming relief would feel so good! just thinking about it caused another squirt to exit Hestia’s pee hole and dampen the insides of her robes once more. Hestia could no longer wait! She felt herself on the edge. Hestia just needed to pee. Was that too much to ask! Hestia’s body wanted her to pee, however. And her immortal body would accomplish this task with or without Hestia’s input on the matter. Hestia felt a sharp squirt escape. She cursed in ancient Greek, something she only does under extreme situations. Hestia managed to shut off her stream. But another erupted from her. Hestia felt her robes get soaked as hot liquid forced its way out of her supposedly all powerful sphincter.

The next thing Hestia knew, she was sitting on the floor, so close to relief, and her bladder was draining. Hestia held her head in her lap and wailed in misery, humiliation, and pain. Hestia’s bladder slowly deflated from her belly. Hestia moaned. Hestia began bawling as her godly bladder involuntarily drained.

“Oh, Hestia,” Persephone said, concern in her voice.

Just like it takes gods several minutes to relieve themselves in the restroom, the same can be said for involuntary wetting themselves. Although, to be fair, it was incredibly rare for a god to wet themselves. Their bladders were extra powerful. But even gods have limits. And Hestia’s bladder went far past that limit.

The thing was, not only are gods and goddesses’ bladders able to last a long time without being drained, they can hold a lot of golden liquid! Even the smaller bladdered gods like Hestia. Hestia’s bladder may be tiny compared to the rest of Olympus, but it was still ten times the size of any mortal bladder on earth. Hestia was able to hold a massive amount of liquids at bay. But after a certain point, even godly bladders give out. And Hestia’s just did. Hestia involuntarily lost the gallons of liquid waste her bladder had been storing. And all those gallons of urine soaked straight through Hestia’s robes and made their new home on the marble floor of Olympus. Hestia’s puddle grew at an alarming rate. After only a few seconds of hiss, the puddle was already twenty feet wide and increasing in size as well as depth.

To make this situation even worse, Athena and Persephone were forced to watch as Hestia’s white robes grew darker and darker. The puddle below Hestia grew outwards from her, extending far past the epicenter of Hestia’s leak.

This was particularly worse for Persephone who ended up getting the blunt of Hestia’s urine attack. Persephone’s feet were soaked in Hestia’s warm liquids. Persephone noticed that Hestia’s urine was burning hot. The puddle was like standing in fire. That did make sense given the fact Hestia was the goddess of fire places! Still, Hestia’s piss was hot! Persephone hoped she didn’t have an infection from holding so long. (If gods can even get those!) Persephone chose a bad day to go barefoot!

Persephone and Athena quickly backed up, allowing the puddle around Hestia to grow to rapid size as Hestia’s godly bladder had enough and emptied all over the place.

Persephone hated watching Hestia pee. Not only was it heartbreaking to see such an awful fate befall such a kind goddess. But moreover, listening to that hiss, standing so close to the explosion of urine, it triggered a need deep inside Persephone. Persephone’s urge had been great before. But now, it was unbearable! Just watching Hestia pee herself made Persephone want to. Persephone remembered all of that pomegranate juice she drank earlier. Liters upon liters of it. Persephone drank so much juice and her kidneys had finished fileting it all days ago! Persephone’s juice/urine had been stored comfortably in her bladder for several days.

But now, the urge was no longer comfortable. It was urgent! Persephone’s bladder needed to let all of that juice escape! Persephone crossed her legs and doubled over. She had to pull it together. She didn’t want to make Hestia feel worse and know what awful effects her explosion of pee created for her comrades. Persephone felt a large bang of urine smash against her sphincter. Persephone’s sphincter rattled worse than Cerberus when his three heads got into a fight. Persephone felt all the pressure inside her bladder move downwards to her vagina area. Persephone wasn’t going to leak yet, but she was extra close. She no longer even felt the pressure in her pelvis. She felt it entirely in her vagina. She hoped that was normal and not a sign of something worse. (Again, gods probably can’t get infections like humans can… Probably… Persephone might want to see Apollo (god of healing) later just to be sure).

Hestia sat there for what felt like an eternity and just peed. The hearth goddess had tried a few times to stop her flow. She was peeing for so long that surely she could manage to stop herself from going farther. But sadly, her sphincter was just too weak. As was her bladder and her urethra. Hestia could not hold again for the immortal life of her!

Eventually, the bathroom door opened and the grain goddess emerged. Demeter’s face fell upon seeing her older sister soak her robes. “Oh, Hestia,” Demeter said in a muted tone. “Are you okay?” Demeter bent down to check on her sister who just sat there weeping and urinating.

Persephone, hand sin crotch, looked back at Athena. “I… Umm… I’m gonna pee…”

“Yeah, go,” Athena moaned.

“Take care of her,” Persephone asked, eyeing Hestia.

Athena nodded. She gave Persephone a look that told her she was sorry for their earlier argument. Persephone responded with the exact same look.

Persephone waded through Hestia’s massive puddle. Persephone hated to do it. Especially barefoot. But it was the only way to the bathroom which the queen of the underworld needed more than ever right now! And so, Persephone pushed on and immersed her lower half into Hestia’s flood. Persephone’s feet were soaked in Hestia’s puddle. Hestia’s godly bladder peed so much, that Persephone quite literally kicked up tiny waves of urine. Hestia's puddle splashed and sloshed all over the floor. It was an actual flood! And Hestia’s bladder still had more to drain.

After finally making it across Hestia’s small golden ocean, Persephone’s feet were soaked and the bottom of her dress was doused in wet, warm pee. Legs stitched together, Persephone then stepped into the washroom and closed the door.

Hestia finished peeing herself a moment later. Athena noted that Hestia’s pee was the color of nectar, the drink of the gods. And judging from the odor, this was indeed a nectar pee.

Demeter had the same thoughts. “Too much nectar is all,’ Demeter said sweetly, helping Hestia to her feet. Hestia was still tearing up. She had stopped sweating and her bladder bulge was gone. But her robes were ruined as was her dignity. “You should have gone before me,” Demeter said. Hestia just sniveled in response. “But I get it,” Demeter went on. “You were just being a good big sister. And now it’s my turn to be a good younger sister,” Demeter firmly placed her arm around Hestia.

“Let’s get you cleaned up,” Demeter said. “Do not worry about the mess. I shall ask the cyclopes to clean this mess up.”

“Hey, Hestia,” Athena said. Hestia slowly looked up. Her face was red with humiliation. “Don’t be embarrassed,” Athena said.

“These things happen.” The truth was, had this been anyone else, Athena would be the first to snap at them and tell them how disgusting they were no matter how desperate they had been. And Athena and Hestia both knew this. But no one can possibly judge or make fun of Hestia. And Athena was no exception.

Hestia just nodded weakly and then allowed herself to be escorted away by Demeter.

This left Athena, the only goddess left, still craving to place her backside down on the nearest toilet. Athena subconsciously ran her hands over her swollen bladder. Athena’s bladder was extended our farther than she had ever seen it in all her years. Athena had to take off her armor. The damned stuff was pressing down on her bladder. Athena left her armor in a pile besides Hestia’s puddle. Athena hoped Persephone would be out soon, or else there may be a second puddle here as well. No! Athena refused to let that happen. She would not pee herself! She was a goddess, a full grown goddess! She could hold it in! Still, her bladder was rather large and hard right now.

Athena made a fist and rapped on the door. “Hey, Persephone, almost done in there?’ She called.

“Not even close!” Persephone’s voice sounded mitigated and soothed. And Athena could guess why.

Looks like it would still be quite a wait. But Athena could do this, she could hold back. It was simply mind over matter. Athena was literally the goddess of wisdom! She specialized in matters of the mind. Athena just had to refuse to acknowledge her bladder’s dangerous condition. But try as she might to ignore her growing urge, she could no longer refuse to recognize the painful pressurization of her bladder. Her sphincter felt as if it was being attacked by a chimera! It was as if Typhon himself was squeezing the life out of the goddess’ weak sphincter muscle.

Athena was a war goddess after all! And right now, she was at a war with her bladder and she feared it was a war that she could not win. Athena knew her time was coming one way or another. If only she had another place to relieve herself! Kind of like how Artemis went to use the woods. That was it…

As the wisdom goddess, Athena knew she would think of something. Athena used the last of her energy to teleport away.

Teleporting with a full bladder was extremely painful. Athena’s bladder felt quite literally as if it were stretched and then pounded down upon. Athena felt ready to pop. But she proceeded with the plan. Athena used her will and disguised as a mortal woman just as Artemis did an eagle earlier that evening.

It was pitch black out and that worked well in favor of Athena! There was a large city in the distance and Athena was in the town square. She recognized this place well. It was the city state of which Athena was a patron god, the most famous of the Greek city states, Athens! Athena figured she was better off relieving herself here than anywhere else!

Hands under her skirt, Athena raced across the pavement, allowing her skirt to billow up behind her. Athena ran and she ran and she entered the public latrine Artemis spoke of.

It was beautiful! Two long benches stood with dozens of holes cut into the smoothed wood. Athena could no longer wait!

As soon as Athena neared the closest hole and lifted her skirt up, the stream jetted out. Athena sat down on the wood just as her stream went pouring from her body. Athena moaned in absolute bliss as her bladder drained and her pee shot down into the wooden hole. Athena’s stream was so noisy, she feared she would wake up the whole city state. But she didn’t care. She was just so grateful to get relief! Athena smiled in joy as she lounged back on the bench, enjoying the feeling of her bladder void itself.

Athena kept her legs spread so she may keep a constant eye on what was happening inside the hole. Just as Athena feared, the urine level inside the hole was increasing towards the top. Athena could feel the warmth of her nectar touch her vulva. And not just the pee squirting from it. But also the pee that was filling up inside.

With much effort, the wisdom goddess managed to stem the flow. She stood, took two steps, sat down in the next hole, and released her flood once more.

And so, Athena went around the public latrine filling up hole after hole with her godly juices. Just as Athena was nearing her end, she noticed there was only one hole left in the public latrine. Athena was relieved no one was around to see this. The way Artemis spoke of this place, Athena had feared it would be packed with mortals in need of relief. Although, to be fair, it was night time. Athena was willing to wager that a place like this would be a lot more popular during the day. No mortal could produce this much urine in one go. No human could ever produce this much urine in their entire lives for that matter! How would Athena explain this to the mortals? Good thing they weren’t here!

Athena instantly kicked herself for thinking that. Just her luck, as soon as Athena began to fully relax, a mortal man appeared. He looked to be no older than thirty, Athena would have guessed. Of course, she hardly knew much about the mortal lifespan. The man nodded to Athena. He then faced the final hole and pulled his toga up, exposing a flapping penis to the wind.

Athena was ready to explode on the man. She was prepared to cure him for having dared show this display in front of a goddess. But then Athena remembered that she was in disguise. This man simply thought she was a regular mortal woman.

“I am sorry, sir,” Athena said. “However, I find it quite rude that you would engage in this act in front of a woman.”

“Sorry,” the man apologized. “But this is the public latrine!”

“I see, and do males and females frequent this place at the same time?’ Athena asked.

“Yes, ma’am, all the time,” the man said.

Artemis hadn’t mentioned that part. Athena found it a little strange that men and women would alleviate themselves so close to one another… Or another person in general for that matter. But then again, humans are a strange bunch. And to be fair, perhaps it is not that weird. Sure, males and females relieve themselves in very different ways, but at the end of the day, each gender is doing the exact same activity… Emptying their bladders.

The man eyed Athena. “I am sorry, ma’am,” the man began placing his toga back on. “I can relieve myself at a later time. I do not wish to disturb you.”

Athena hesitated. This man showed kindness and compassion. This man - while clearly not desperate - still needed relief. He, however, was willing to put that need aside due to a stranger stating she was uncomfortable with it.

Athena was getting relief. Who was she to deny this man his? Plus, Athena knew from personal experience how uncomfortable a full bladder was. Even if not desperate, it is not fun to have to hold your fluid. The same fluid your body wishes to expel for that matter!

“No, I am fine,” Athena found herself saying. “Please, go on, do your business. I shall turn away if you wish.”

“That is not necessary ma'am, but are you sure?” The stranger asked. “I do not wish to make you uncomfortable.”

“I am fine, honest,” the winsome goddess said. “Just confused is all. In my home city state, you see, our public latrines are one gender only. And even then, we may only go one at a time.”

“Really,” the man lifted his toga and golden liquid began shooting forth from his penis. Athena did her best not to stare, but she could not help herself. “I find that strange. How would everyone be able to relieve themselves in this case?”

Athena considered the long goddesses’ bathroom line on Olympus. “It is… Difficult,” Athena assured the stranger.

“By the way,” he said. “Do you know why all these other holes are filled?”

Athena felt herself swallow. “I suppose they have yet to be emptied.”

The two peed in silence, listening to the cricket’s chirp as well as the sound of the other peeing. Athena was relieved (literally) that she didn’t have any pee left inside. She didn’t know what she would have done next. This man was using the final hole. It is a good thing Athena stopped when she did!

Athena found some pessoi - old shards of vase - beside her on the bench. Athena used this to wipe her private area and she allowed her skirt to fall back into place. Athena nearly forgot this fellow was here, watching. But like a gentleman, he kept his eyes focused on his own stream, completely ignoring hers.

The man soon finished. He shook off and allowed his toga to fall back into place. The man turned and nearly crashed into Athena.

“Oh, ma’am, I thought you left,” the man said. “Did you need something?”

“Yes,” Athena said. “I wish to thank you and reward you.”

“Pardon?” The fellow asked.

The wisdom goddess shed her disguise. Now that her bladder was properly drained, it was much easier to use her powers! Athena appeared before the strange man in her godly form. She also was back in wearing her full battle armor and she even held her spear at her side.

“A… Athena?” The man crooked. Athena’s gray eyes filled with wisdom sunk into the man. “My lady,” the man bowed. He quickly looked up. “Did… Did I just…”

“Urinate next to a divine goddess? Yes, you did,”

The man looked ready to be sick. “Ma’am… I am so, soooo sorry… I…”

Athena held up a hand to silence the stranger. “What is your name?’

“My name? Cace,” the man replied.

“Well, Cace,” Athena said. “Under normal circumstances I may be angry. But to tell you the truth…” Athena let out a deep breath. “I am just so relieved! Not that you need to know, but there was a long line for the ladies’ room on Olympus. I eventually gave up waiting and came down to earth to relieve myself. And it felt grand!” Athena had no idea what had gotten into her. She just felt so overjoyed that it was over with, it made her all giddy.

“I… I am glad you feel better, my lady,” Cace said. He eyed the many holes overflowing with Athena’s bladder contents.

“Yes,” Athena said, reading this young man’s mind. “That is all mine.”

“My lady,” Cace apologized. “If I had known… I never would have…”

“But you did not know,” Athena said sharply. “And I believe I told you I did not mind if you relieved yourself. And I did not mind. That said, I am grateful to you for showing such kindness to a stranger. You were willing to walk away and hold your urine so I, a stranger, may alleviate herself in private.”

“I… I didn’t have to go that badly anyway, my lady,” Cace said.

“Be that as it may, you were still seen showing kindness. I do not let that go unrecognized,” Athena moved her body in a full circle, admiring the city around her. “I have always admired this city. I may be biased, however. This city was named after myself, of course. I have a gift for you as well as every one in this city.” Athena pointed to the couple dozen filled up holes of liquid waste. “You see my urine?’

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Godly urine has magical properties,” Athena explained. “I wish you to alert the citizens of this city that my urine shall heal the sick and the injured. All you must do is drink a handful of my nectar. Can you do that for me, my good man?”

“Yes, my lady!” Cace said eagerly, throwing in a salute for good measure.

“Thank you, Cace, for everything,” the wisdom goddess said.

Cace nodded and then turned to alert his city of the magical godly urine.

Athena took that as her cue to leave. Athena was anxious to get home back to Mount Olympus and take a nap. Holding in all that pee was tiresome… Even for a goddess!

Let me know if you think I should do more stories like this. I can do more Greek goddesses. Perhaps some of the minor ones, like the muses. Or I could do another pantheon entirely. The possibilities are endless!
