I was thinking about a female (one I have written about) having a scenario of pee desperation as a car wash worker in the summer heat. It could be to raise money for a cause and the person has to keep up hydration in the 100 + degrees of heat. Eventually, she ends up bursting during a busy pile up of cars waiting to be manually washed. She can't hold it and pees while dousing herself with water from a hose. I'm not sure though.

The only problem is the certain technical details, such as what chemicals, what color and shape or size of sponges, and how long is the shift? Also, if its automated or outside with buckets and hoses for water. I am not sure. Honestly, I have run out of a lot of steam for writing such fiction. I am still on the fiction involving the genie which is lengthy too. I don't know what I will say or how she gets so damn unnaturally bursting. Also, not sure about how harsh I will be upon the protagonist and the obstacles. What obstacles are there for car wash cleaning girls and women? Do they have a manager or supervisor? I might choose another scenario for the story instead of car wash.
