Good afternoon to all. How is your weekend going? Currently, not making new ideas for omo fiction. So far I haven't figured out any new ideas and ones I have, well I haven't yet crafted a storyline for them yet. What new ideas you think would work for desperation fiction, whereby a female becomes or is already desperate or bursting big time, or severely ready to blow, facing obstacles every time she wants to pee into a toilet in private, but either makes it, makes with some spurting, spurting and has an accident, has an accident, or has a huge accident that drenched her beautiful legs? Also, what is your feedback for the fiction I have posted so far? What do you think of my works and is there room for improvement? Which works do you think we're my best, and want to see more of that kind more often? Which characters do you want to see more often? And which kinds of storyline do you want to see for those characters?

Funny. The orchestra doesn't understand until afterwards. Got it. Any other ideas?

Any feedback for my stories and which stories you likes, for which I should write more just like it.
