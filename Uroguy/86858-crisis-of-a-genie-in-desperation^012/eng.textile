Crisis of a genie in desperation

The Fairy King soon found himself surrounded by fairy fighters, ready to fend off the monster attacks. Dran appeared to shoot breaths of fire upon the monsters. In fact, he squashed a few with his weight. Hordes of monsters began showing up in mass droves. The Fairy King advised the team to use their default weapons as they won't break down and disappear from wear and tear.

Their other weapons obtained from their time in dungeon levels can't be repaired without repair powder, which right now was hacked open by monsters at Gaffer's buggy of goods. Macho and Komacho did their best to fight off the monsters attacking Gaffer but it was just too much, until Dran stepped in laying waste to all the monsters there. "Where are all these monsters coming from? And some of them I don't recognize Fairy King." Toan asked.

"Don't worry. We are here and I will help you." The Fairy King said. The doors to Divine Beast Cave still glowed red and surrounded by a wall of dark cloud energies. It was sealed off due to the spell placed upon it. Who could that be? Was it connected to the dark cloud that surrounded Ruby? Speaking of which, she remained trapped walking for seemed like forever down that corridor. It didn't seem to end anywhere.

Ruby was beginning to feel exhausted and her need to go jumped to a significant pang and a stinging feeling. She had to go and it was going to get worse. Ruby did all she could to stave off the urge to drink water. For the past two hours, she had been walking through the darkness not finding a single end in sight, feeling hotter and sweatier as time went on. Her need to go jumped to mild desperation and it was only rising. She started drinking water more often as the temperature seemed to rise. She tried to ignore the urge to drink water but the heat was too much.

By now, she was started cracking her knuckles and fingers as a sign that she needed to find an exit and use the toilet. Ruby drank water constantly as she felt thirsty soon after drinking water. How was this possible for so much heat to accumulate and from where. She wasn't anywhere near a source internal heat beneath the ground. And she wasn't in the desert heat. So what was it? Ruby continued walking forward, keeping one hand against the wall to her left and moving in small strides. "What .. the heck .. is going on here? Why is it so hot?" she wondered.

"What was the plan, thirst me to death? mess with my head? what? I wish I knew what that vile peace of filth was up to." Ruby thought to herself. During this current hour, she kept on drinking water profusely. It was so instinctive and she wanted more, but she reclaimed her senses to realized that she might drink herself out of all the water available to her. Ruby went to check to find she still had the 4 water bottles left to her. Or at least she thought it was. Her eyesight was a little foggy but at times it was clear while moving around to blurry. During the times it was clear, she saw only 2 bottles remained, with one almost done in her right hand.

She had to be careful not to drink it all. Ruby kept walking for another 15 minutes through the darkness, feeling hopeless in her bid to find a way out, that is, until the hallway started to light up. It wasn't very bright but it wasn't dark. It was dimly lit due to torches burning a dull blue color. The corridor remained hot and dark, though not as much now. Ruby continued down the bend around the corner and down the corridor until she saw began to see vegetation and sand. The ceiling started to show wooden beams like those seen in Shipwreck dungeon, the vegetation from Wise Owl Forest, and the sand from the dessert lands.

She didn't understand if this was a trick or if this was the back floor areas for Divine Beast Cave. The description still remained as she was still inside a cave. But the environment seemed different now. Still no monsters either and no other persons in sight. But now she was becoming slightly more desperate as now she had to go and empty her bladder. But where was she to go. And who knows what might show up. She wasn't going to render herself a sitting target with her pants down. Ruby had to act fast and find a way out of this unknown dungeon, wherever it was.

....

Outside, Norune Village was still fighting for its survival. Toan, Goro, Xiao, Macho and Komacho, The Fairy King and his remaining defenders managed to stay hunkered down in Dran's windmill tower, along with the rest of the people. Alnet and Carl still remained in their homes. The monsters couldn't enter and gave up on attacking them. Of course, much of their home was ruined save for their bedroom at the hands of Chariots and their Captains. Old Gaffer was hit by a gooey mist by a curse rose and now moved slower than ever. Sadly, the team didn't have a gooey patch for relief and the fairy magic was used up fighting off the monsters. They only had so much left.

Toan didn't realize so many monsters could be in one place and so powerful. "Fairy King who's doing this?". "The Dark Genie is doing this as part of some effort to satisfy his master, a human man from the East. His is Colonel Flag. Men of the east are ambitious for power and use technology to crush their enemies, expand their kingdoms, and remain the sole dictator. Basically, it means they take over other people's homes and make the people their slaves to rule over with harsh laws to benefit themselves." Toan couldn't believe it. How evil some humans can be. But then he remembered what a certain individual mentioned.

This person from Queens Village mentioned how the men of the east are bloodsucking monsters who only care about conquering and taking over. So the word of the Fairy King confirmed this. "Was the Dark Genie created by these men of the east Fairy King?". "Yes, but not intentionally. I will explain later. We need to get these monsters out of here Toan."

"But how? Our weapons are almost out and you don't have much magic. Furthermore, we don't have enough repair powder.". Macho and Komacho were exhausted and Dran couldn't keep this up either. Luckily, Master Utan was there too as Treant warned him, but he too couldn't fight off all those monsters forever.

They just had to hold out for hope, which wasn't going to happen unless something changed. Toan had one more question. "Fairy King, do you know what happened to Ruby?"

"I was going to ask you the same thing Toan." Now Toan was worried big time. For all he knew, Ruby was dead or captured by the Dark Genie. Goro had a few more hits before his weapon went out of his possession from wearing out. Then, he would have his default weapon which would be useless against these monsters. These monsters were too strong for such a weapon still not leveled up to +2 and beyond. And some of these monsters weren't even from Divine Beast Cave, Wise Owl Forest, of Shipwrecked.

I hope you're all enjoying this story. This is going to be another long drawn out story for a huge build up before the flood. I am also brainstorming stories, such as about Susan Storm, a female car wash worker, and may be another story with Gwenndolinne or Xenobia. Perhaps, Germaphobe girl from Bursting School Day Bladders.

*014*2023-03-14 19:30

Ruby continued her journey towards wherever for the past 1 hour. She didn't know where she was or where she was going. It was still dark and every so many quarter miles was a blue-flamed torch. The torches were of course burning a dull flame and not very bright. It was bright enought to just see ahead. Ruby was officially desperate and hot, sweating a lot. Furthermore, she kept drinking water as the temperature went higher now. She walked awkwardly and briskly as she had to go.

As stated earlier, she wasn't going to relieve herself out here. And there was no telling who would find her, and when. She kept her legs close together, her hands clenched in a fist, trying not to hold herself, and trying not think about the issue down below. The path ahead continued to be a hybrid of Shipwreck, Wise Owl Forest, and desert cave surroundings. Ruby became tired and out of breath from all the heat, and walking. She stopped and squatted, leaning against a rock to catch her breath.

"Where am I, and how do I get out of here? Hopefully my friends are doing alright. (Panting) ....... oh I'm so thirsty. But I have to pee." Suddenly, a noise reverberated throughout the corridor ahead. It wasn't one she heard of before nor had she the slightest idesd what it could be. It was the sound of something scraping, sounding on and off, moving all around her. She looked everywhere to see nothing but darkness. She grabbed herself instinctively to prevent an accident.

A glowing aura of holy was generated in an attempt to ward off the possibly offending entity. "I'm dangerous. Stay back." Ruby warned. Again, the scraping noise sounded off as it seemed to move all around Ruby, as if something encircled her. But what? Ruby looked all over to see nothing. Then it stopped. For several seconds, nothing could be heard but the deafening silence so eerie it makes for a shiver up the spine.

Her shivering only worsened her need to go as her pee shimmied closer to the exit hole. The silence broke with the booming of a loud roar for which only terror and fear should be accompanying as the response. Red eyes appeared in the distance ahead, one or two followed by another, and another, and bat screeches too. Wings flapping and buzzing followed, loud footsteps striking the ground, and scraping continued. Ruby realized these were monsters for which their normal counterparts weren't as imposing and threatening.

Out of warning, the sand rose up as three protrusions like mountains, rising up to cover something or someone, the middle one grew dark impressions that took the shape of menacing eyes and a mouth, while the other two quickly took the shape of claws. It was a monster Ruby never saw before and quite off-putting as her guard wasn't up. It was a desert monster known as a Dune. It is usually seen in the Sun and Moon Temple. It was a monster that didn't seem to fit the description of anything Toan saw.

She couldn't understand this strange creature. The dune struck down Ruby as to knock her to the ground. Ruby put her palm forward to prevent herself from falling on her butt. She attacked back with a holy attack. But it proved to be of very little potency. The dune enveloped her as the monsters behind it kept approaching inch by inch. Ruby moved a little stiffly but still enough to try removing the sand off her. Brushing off the sand off didn't work as it just accumulated on her hands, her body, her legs, and now her face.

The dune receded closer to the ground as it began its horrid means of burying her under its weight. For a moment, the dune covered her entirely until lightning sparks emerged from within. It kept sparking until at last the dune disintegrated by a lightning attack. The sand exploded all over the place and from underneath came Ruby. Spitting out the sand, she quickly got up and began charging another attack with lightning element. She launched it at the monsters. It collided with a bunch of bats, which did cause them to fly a little low to the ground but undeterred.

She could see a cave bat, an evil bat, hornet, yammich, titans, and a few barons. The rest of the monsters weren't affected as much. These weren't just monsters that were stronger. But they were powered by something strong in the dark side. It was evident as the monsters glowed a purple color. Ruby recognized whose handywork this was. She realized that she needed to boost her powers in all the elements to face these foes. Otherwise it would take a lot of wear and tare on her weapon. Luckily, she has her repair powder on hand.

And she had her platinum ring, which she was going to use when her gold ring became gold ring level 5.

*015*2023-03-20 03:09

Ruby didn't bother to shoot a charged attack. She chose to shot a few rounds of lightning attack at the enemies approaching. Of course, her attacks fared far less than her charged attack. She chose to walk fast in the opposite direction and get to safety. Sadly, that meant going back through the dark corridor. Again, she would be feeling hot and of course, that meant possibly drinking more water.

All that fast walking caused more swishing and urgency to go. Ruby didn't have time to worry about that as her life was on the line and her means of escaping was still out of her reach. Ruby was becoming mildly desperate from all the water she dranl on top of all the water she drank throughout the day, the wine from dinner, water during her training, and now through his strange dungeon.

Ruby could feel it now, her bladder stung with a pang as it became more full. And her exit hole muscles filled up too. But what could she do. As she kept moving, she began to sweat more and more due to the heat. Before, she was just walking, but now she moved faster. She needed more water or else she would pass out. But more water meant more need to go. And she drank through all her bottles of water throughout today.

She would have run faster if it weren't for the heat and her need to go. But luckily she outran those monsters, which saw her and knew which way she was going. It wouldn't be long before they caught up to her.

...

Outside Divine Beast Cave, the situation became dire. The doors to the windmill weren't going to hold. It was 30 minutes of nothing but monsters banging on the doors and doing everything possible to keep them shut. But it was soon clear that they would eventually break through to kill them all. Alnet and Carl were still inside their home. So far the monsters didn't seem to notice them inside the closet yet.

But how long would that last? Toan, Xiao, and Renee made peace with each other, knowing they would die together. Renee thanked Toan and Xiao for being such a blessing and good children. Goro didn't have that, much Renee and the townspeople still thanked him for all he did. He wanted to go out with a bang, like his father Fudoh. Not surrendering like a coward was his way. The Fairy King and his remaining troops prepared for their deaths, hearing the banging growing worse and worse. Each bang was more violent and intense than before.

That kept going on for another 5 minutes unabated. Dran was overrun along with Master Utan by monsters. They weren't able to do anything. Suddenly, the last bang on the door was followed by silence. Silence followed by more silence, and so on. Toan and the others waited for their door in suspense. Suddenly, out of the blue, a loud noise flying overhead was heard followed by explosion noises all over.

The monsters groaned and panicked. One of them yelled "Let's get out of here!" in his own tongue. They began to scatter but to everyone inside the windmill, no one knew what was going on. Then, a voice could be heard from outside, calling out to Toan. "Toan, Toan it's me Theo from Brownboo Village. Open up. The monsters are dead. It's safe now to come out." Everyone inside thought it might be a trap but the Fairy King went to investigate. He teleported outside to see who it was that was outside.

For several minutes, there was silence and suspense. Then, the Fairy King came back and informed them it was Theo and it was safe to come outside. Toan and the villagers were relieved and confused. They came outside to see their homes in ruin but the invaders gone. They couldn't believe it. Theo explained they called upon Osmond and his crew from the Moon to help them.

Toan thanked Theo and his moon people friends immensely. But the magic surrounding the entrance to Divine Beast Cave still persisted. Dran and Master Utan also saw it but could do nothing, as they didn't know magic spells to conjure. Master Utan left to protect the Matataki Village, Wise Owl Forest and Brownboo Village, along with Goro.

Toan made sure everyone was still alive and well. He even checked on Alnet and Carl who were thankfully still alive. But now, came rebuilding Norune Village, followed by searching for Ruby.

*016*2023-03-20 16:39

I know this story is taking awhile. But for this story, I want to show a progression to becoming bursting, being bursting, possible leaking, and eventually the big climax of the flood. I had to set up everything that came before this. I understand if no one wants to comment after the story is done. At least if read, that's all that matters to me. Back to the story:

Ruby walked backwards for awhile before stopping. She was tired and exhausted from the heat. It was an hour's worth of walking through the corridor and now she was severely desperate. Along the way, she fought off cave bats and hornets with lightning elemental attacks. Of course, since they were very strong, she repaired her weapon too with repair powder.

She gained experience points via the red magical droppings from the deaths of the bats and hornets. This brought her weapon to gold ring +5, and she could now turn this into a synth sphere, which she could attach to her platinum ring. She already turned her platinum ring into a +1, and already more powerful an armband than her gold ring.

Now as an attachment, she could use this as an upgrade for her platinum ring. But the only issue was the life points for her platinum ring. It had less than what was accumulated with her gold ring. She would have to be careful with how many times she repaired it. Unlike her default weapon, this one disappears if broke completely from wear and tare. Her gold ring was back to being just gold ring. It wasn't upgraded.

The platinum ring could easily be morphed into a new armband weapon. Default weapons can't be upgraded by evolving into a completely new armband wepon of higher caliber but nondefaukt weapons could. But each time she attacked, it was a slightly weaker attack. The reason was her focus. It shifted slowly and instinctively towards her need for relief. Her bladder was filling up and more, sending more if towards her urethra exit hole.

She now stood hunched forward and trying not wedge her hands between her thighs in her crotch. But it was apparent now that was becoming too difficult. She had to go and badly. Her desperation was now severe and only going higher. But she couldn't just stop to pull down her harem pants with all the dangers lurking abound in this strange dungeon area. And where were all the monsters coming from?

It was as if they were being teleported and powered by dark forces. But she knew a dark side wielder with that kind of power of space and time. "It has to be him." Ruby thought. "May be he is the one melding the dungeon areas together to make this weird dungeon area to throw me off balance and taking monsters from different areas over here. But the heat? What's that for ..... (gasp) the Sun and Moon Temple. It's in the middle of the desert. So some of these creatures might be on the desert."

Ruby scissored her legs passed each other trying to lessen the urge to go. She didn't want to wet herself either and keep moving. But she also needed a source of water. She was thirsty again and if she didn't drink more water, she would be in serious trouble with her health. She was a genie but even genies need water. But where she going to get more water? There wasn't an oasis anywhere as far as she could see.

Ruby remembered there being a right and left turn when the doors opened to the next floor. And the part of the corridor ahead of her where she first encountered that dune creature. But that led to dangerous monsters, and the entrance towards this floor wasn't nearby either. It would take her another hour + to get back there. And right now, she was exhausted, plus fighting a wave of desperation urge to go. Her urethra was filling up, paining it via expansion. The pressure against it made it more taught along with her contracting it to hold it all inside.

Ruby again squatted to deal with the urge to go. She didn't want to wet herself but she had to find a way out of here. Or a place of immense privacy.

*017*2023-03-21 15:43

Ruby groaned as the urge persisted, her exit hole throbbed from contracting her exit hole. The churning pain continued to radiate from within and cause discomfort. Ruby had to find her way out here and fast. She didn't plan on staying here and longer and why should she? This was nothing more than a perversion of space and time to isolate her from the team.

Or was this a stupid trial? Either way it was was time to leave. Ruby was done with this place. She was done being messed with. But she could feel the instinctive need to release her pent up pressure within her bladder and urethra. If she didn't, it would be horrible flood for which she would have to endure. Ruby was a genie of great power and of great standing as King's wife. She wasn't going to allow herself to flood her pants.

She got up slowly and began moving again. However, this time she heard scraping along the ground. She stopped and looked down only to see her feet surrounded by sand. Her heart sank, filled with dread from the last encounter by a previous dune. It was slowly covering her shoes as it surrounded her feet, trying to engulf her like quick sand when you step into it. She wasn't going to let that happen again.

She jumped up to hover, and float towards the roof of the corridor. Once high enough to be out of reach, she generated a bolt of lightning, and launched it at the dune. The dune disintegrated, then reintegrated together. "Darn. This dune is stronger than the one I faced earlier. I'd better get rid of it." Ruby said. But again she was reminded by her need to go. She groaned as she kept her arms and legs close to herself.

She really had to go badly, and as time passes, the urgency grows more intense. She had to do something fast. The dune remained stationary as it waited for its prey to descend into its sand clutches. Ruby scissored her legs while in a fetal position, desperately trying to prevent a flood. Ruby had to fight off this foes and fast without wasting life points for her weapon. Then, out of the blue screeching accompanied from the darkness. Ruby turned to look behind her, immediately seeing a cave bat flying directly at her. It surrounded and harried her from every direction.

She flung her hands to show it away, but again she grabbed her crotch to prevent an accident. She had to find a place to go and fast, or else. Ruby's position is midair was starting to dwindle as she hovered up and down, trying to stay afloat but wanting to get away from the bat. The dune waited as it was only a matter of time. The bat kept flying around Ruby, looking for a place to inject its poison via a bite.

Ruby wearily put out her hand and went to generate lightning. But it didn't show much in the way of being threatening. Her focus was thinned by her need to survive but also by the signals from her urethra to take a leak. But then it occurred to her she had other items on hand. She took out a bomb nut and threw it at the dune. The dune looked perplexed for 3 seconds before it exploded to its death.

Ruby took out a gooey patch and, at the right time put it into the bats mouth. The bat, trying to bite her hands, ended up with a gooey mouth as it started to make the bat move slower and feel as though it was stuck in a gooey patch. The bat couldn't spit out the patch and couldn't bite Ruby. The bat eventually fell down, squirming like a bug thats been swatted but not killed and landing on its backside.

Ruby hovered back down and met with more bats, hornets, and an incoming sprint by a dasher. Ruby immediately attacked back with a lightning attack that caused damage but didn't stop the momentum of the dasher. She ended being pushed backwards, falling on her butt. She stiffened her body as she tried to prevent an accident, even so much as a spurt.

But that added to her urge. She quickly generated an attack again and took out the bats, hornets and the dasher. Her weapon too more ware and tear, but she still had repair powder. But she had to use it asap. She carefully got up and went in the direction opposite of the one where the monsters kept coming from. Ruby felt it was time to leave and get to the entrance doors to this dungeon. She knew that once at the next dungeon the doors close. But perhaps she could find a way to open it.

Or perhaps, find an exit. May be she should have taken the left turn after walking through those doors to this floor. But that was still far away. And she still felt thirsty. She needed water to replenish the water she sweated out. If she kept her eyes open, looked for other passages, she might find a treasure chest, one possibly with a water bottle. The heat was unbearable.

Ruby continued her long journey towards the entrance doors, despite the heat and the growing need to go. She walked as quickly as possible, despite her growing need to go, and her need for more water. Ruby felt each and every slosh and swish of her golden liquid, feeling it accumulate near the exit hole. Ruby could feel the urgency of her need to go so badly, and it's increasing intensity. Ruby occasionally stopped to pee dance and at times, squat to hold it. She knew the monsters were right behind her so she had to keep moving.

For a while, there were torches before there was pitch black darkness. And who knows what might rear its ugly head. As much as Ruby didn't want to know, but she didn't want more surprises. Using her repair powder, she proceeded to heal her weapon before generating fire element for lighting the way. Ruby could see nothing for a long while. It wasn't going to be for another few hours before she got to the entrance doors to this warped floor.

..

Outside, it was dawn and most of the rubble was cleaned up. The Fairy King finally recharged most of his magic, healed the towns people, and left to go check on other villages already rebuilt, as well as Yellow Drops on the Moon. Toan and his friends stayed behind to help rebuild Norune Village. Dran seemed nervous about what was stirring inside his home. Toan couldn't help but wonder if Ruby was alright. At times, he stared at the door to Dran's cave, but he had to help the villagers of his home.

Goro saw his home still intact. And after visiting Queens, Goro deduced that since Quees was alright, perhaps this was merely an attack against them. Perhaps, it was a message sent against Toan for other villages to not get the wrong idea. The Dark Genie was out there, ready for more onslaught whenever and wherever. This wasn't good! And this attack nearly destroyed everyone like last time. Even if the Fairy King put everyone and everything into atla spheres, it would be too dangerous to put inside Divine Beast Cave.

Luckily, the Fairy King showed up this time. But next time could be different. By breakfast time and the calling of the rooster, the villagers were back on their feet. They thanked Toan for all the help, as well as giving thanks for the Fairy King, Dran, Master Utan, and the moon people. Toan wanted to help mote but his mother told him it was better they retrieve Ruby from harmsway, continue their quest to stop the Dark Genie, and save the world.

"It doesn't help to stay here watching guard while another attack happens. You'll just have to rebuild this village again. But it doesn't stop the problem." Renee said. Toan asked back "What if he attacks while I'm on the journey to destroy the Dark Genie?". Renee replied "You could never fail us. I love you and I'm proud of you. Now go. Don't return until you destroy the Genie of evil or if you need to see Dran! Go and find Ruby too!". Toan nodded in understanding. He left with Xiao, and Goro returned. They met up with Dran to figure out a way to get inside the cave.

"I don't see anyway inside the cave. My entrance is also blocked too. I wish the Fairy King or moon people had some magic to help us." Dran said. He didn’t feel confident about resolving this matter. He didnt know magic spells. But the Fairy King returned. "I have regained some of my power but not enough. Luckily, I have brought a few genies with me. (This part is not real. It never happened in the game.) One of them was a female named Tulip, while the other was male genie named Sapphire. The male was the older brother to Ruby.

"I hear my sister was trapped inside this cave. And you let this happen?". Sapphire asked. He spoke with authority and power. Toan felt a little nervous about knowing who he was. Toan knew Ruby had a temper and her brother seemed more imposing than Ruby.

*018*2023-03-25 02:03

Toan understood what this male genie had just said. This was the sibling to Ruby, which as far as he could tell, was a fully fledged genie. He spoke with tact and caution so as not to anger this genie. "Ruby is your sister, and a newly acquired ally against the Dark Genie. I would never abandon anyone. But she chose to help us fight against the darkness to the east. Ruby is talented and very capable no doubt. I offered to go inside the cave with her but she chose to do it alone. I respected her choice."

Sapphire looked on intently, listening to what the human boy spoke, and of course the words chosen very carefully. "My village was celebrating being alive and well ever since it was attacked by the Dark Genie and Ruby ate with us, then went back inside the cave to finish fighting. When she is determined to do something there is no stopping her. She left while the celebration was going on when we're attacked by a horde of monsters. Dark magic was used and is still currently used to seal off the exit from anyone outside or inside the cave."

Sapphire looked at the doors to see a red glowing. He could tell powerful magic was used here. He looked back at Toan and replied. "I understand my sister has a strong sense of doing things alone but this isn't good. Your village looks ransacked and clearly there are dead monsters strewn about. But still yoy should have ............... okay you're Tulip. Let's get those doors opened. My sister's life is more important than arguing and blaming." He came to the ground with Tulip, turned towards the doors to Divine Beast Cave, and walked to them. Once at the doors, they with the Fairy King began chanting spells to remove the magic of the Dark Genie.

It wouldn't be so easy but they had to try. The Fairy King knew it wouldn't be possible by himself. Toan and his friends looked on with patience and yearning to see their friend come back. They did miss Ruby and cared about her. She was tough and no nonsense despite being beautiful and physically appealing. And she did her own work, not like some women who look pretty while doing nothing. And she was fierce and courageous, and let nothing stand in her way. She had heart and soul! But would that help in her current predicament?

.......

Deep inside the cave, things weren't looking better. Ruby spent the next several hours trying to stay awake and push throught the heat to get back to the starting point for this dungeon floor. Every so often a bat approached or a chest lay there, so strange a chest was there. It wasn't there before. And as usual it was a mimic monster, masquerading as a treasure chest. Wasting magic was bad but in case she couldn't use magic she needed items for her protection. She saved using her items and used magic.

Focusing on magic use was hard enough with an intense need to go that only rose to higher intensity. Ruby kept her legs tightly pressed together, walking slowly than before and only taking quick small strides. Sometimes, she had to stop and squat to lessen the urge or bob up and down with her legs double crossed. She couldn't do this as monsters could appear anywhere, anytime, and anyplace. And the ones from earlier and behind were slow moving but still saw her. They might still be on the move.

Now though, Ruby was bursting. Her urge was an incessant wave of desperation, constant and painful. Her bladder kept expanding, dumping more water into her poor tiny exit hole. It strained to construct while trying to hold back the growing weight of her liquid gold as it put more undo pressure on it. It churned and felt as if it was churning inside out. Nothing would help more than being able to empty her bladder. "I wish I was out of this place and back at Toan's house or my house in Queens."

Suddenly, she heard a rumbling noise from behind her in the distance. She turned to see only the darkness pervading the corridor behind her. She felt the rumbling approaching her, heard it growing ever more loud. Ruby kept walking forward as fast she could while trying not to have an accident. But each step she took was insufficient as her instincts screamed louder. At last, the sound heard from behind was so close she couldn't resist her instinctive urge.

Ruby jumped and hovered midair, allowing the rumbling to pass by her. When lighting the way, she saw it was not one, not two, not three but four rockanoffs. They rolled in ready to run her over, or bite her. These moving boulders almost flattened Ruby to a pancake. Luckily, she jumped out of the way in time and now in the prime position to attack to kill. But her need to go was too strong of an urge. She just couldn't bring herself to stay afloat. Ruby found herself slowly descending. One of the rockanoffs took a ready-to-sprint stance to attack her.

Ruby, whimpered as she tried to fight off her wave if desperation. If she didn't get control of the situation she was done for. She had to will herself to stay afloat in the air for her safety. She inhaled much air and began focusing on herself staying outside the reach of these monsters. Since they couldn't fly or jump, it was imperative she stay at least two feet above the ground. Ruby still descending managed to kick the nearest rockanoff in his right eye. It squealed in pain as it closed the eyelids.

The other rockanoffs didn't imaging that someone would do that. With great offense, they began glowing purple and their eyes turned a red color. Ruby knew that meant trouble. She managed to stay a foot off the ground and cause herself to ascend again. The other rockanoffs tried to attack her but it was no use. She was just too high for their reach. Ruby curled into a ball trying to hold back her gold liquid that was about to explode out of her. She carefully refocused on her urethra and contracted it again, which only caused her more pain.

Ruby was so very badly bursting and the threat of attack so near. She managed to charge her attack and strike them causing some damage. It wasn't enough and her platinum weapon, took some damage. It wasn't enough to repair it yet, but she had to be careful. She charged another ball of lightning to attack and get rid of the threats completely. The rockanoffs knew better than to stay stationary and move back. Just as she was about to attack, Ruby stopped and re-grabbed her crotch. Her wave of desperation surged again, this time it was twice as strong. She couldn't hold it back so easily as before.

The rockanoffs stood their waiting for their enemy to lower herself and be within reach for attacking. Ruby whimpered again as her need to go was becoming a nuisance. She had enough and generated an attack strong enough and launched it at the rockanoffs. They withered to nothingness, clearing the way for Ruby to come back down. But her monster troubles weren't over. A growling noise could be heard from behind. She turned around to see a dragon slowly moving towards her. Ruby got up, moving away from the threats that came.

Sadly the cave bats caught up and began harassing her. Flying from all directions, they squeaked and flapped all around her. She swatted and shewed them but to no avail. Eventually, one of them latched onto her arm and bit her. She cried out in pain as the bat began inserting its poison into. The other bats began biting her. Ruby came to the ground, one hand grabbing her crotch and wincing in pain as she tried to not have an accident.

Ruby sat there on her folded legs hunched over and trying to shew away the bats. For 30 seconds, she remained like this crying at the bats to get off. But the one bat still held on with its fangs. Eventually, Ruby managed to pull herself together, repaired her weapon, and charged a lightning attack that grew and grew, zapping all the bats and killing them. She grabbed her right hand that bled and oozed out poison too. She drank an antidote to cure her of the bat poison and kept going. She was going blind from the lack of water and exhaustion.

If she didn't find a source of water and a place to hide or escape, it would be all over.

...

"This spell is very advanced dark magic, even for me." Sapphire mentioned. "Even I can't open it!" Tulip said. The Fairy King continued meditation to help these two genies to open the door. They had to find Ruby and fast. Her life was of great importance in the fight against the Dark Genie. Toan and his friends looked on with worry and angst. None of their weapons penetrated the spell cast over the door nor was it weakened.

To them, Ruby was either hurt or in serious danger. They hoped she was okay. Neither genie nor the Fairy King gave up trying to open the door to Dran's home. They had to find a way. Even some of the villagers from Brownboo Village tried to perform their magic but to no avail. Sapphire felt overcome with emotions and anxiety, turning towards Toan with focus. "You did this and now she's stuck inside some cave. If only you went with her none of this would have happened."

Tian looked on with worry and frustration. But he wasn't willing to cede over to shame and guilt. As much as he could understand, he wasn't willing to descend into depression. After several hours, and of course attacking the magical spell, the means by which they could enter through started becoming more available. The red barrier was becoming less potent and more transparent. With a few more tries, they managed to break down the barrier. Toan, Xiao, Goro, Sapphire and Tulip, and Komacho marched onwards to find Ruby.

Once inside, they began searching through the first few dungeons. Since there was no way to know which dungeons Ruby went through, they had to try each one. And they knew the dungeon lay out was different each time. (That is part of the game itself!"). As for the Fairy King, he helped Dran by removing the barrier upon his exit from the cave. Then, he had to depart to recharge his magic. Plus, he had to make sure headquarters still existed. (Again, not what happened!) The first few levels were easy for all of them, even Komacho. Komacho always used his fists like Macho and Wilder.

What was strange was the lack of monsters to fight. It seemed they moved from one dungeon to another. But they don't know how to use the key to exit. Or do they? But how did they all do it? None of it seemed to make sense as they perused each room and corridor. They expected to find more monsters than this but instead found thr place less populated. Something displaced them or they found a reason to leave. Could it have been the invasion force that wrecked Norune Village or were there more still to come?

Xiao stsrted complaining about her feet and yawning. "(Yawn) .... I'm tired. Hmmmmm!" Xiao said as she curled up into a ball. Toan gave her escape powder and let her go back outside. Toan did try her wakeup due to the urgency and it wouldn't look good. But it was decided to let her go. They didnt have time for this and convinced him to do it.

...

Deep inside the cave, and within the twisted netherworld, Ruby sweat like crazy. Her vision was blurred more often. She needed water and fast. Not only that, she needed water. She fought off bats popping up right and left. A few bats bit her but she managed to fend them off all while holding herself. She panted from the effort and exhaustion. At some point, there weren't any monsters for the rest of her journey as she approached the entrance to this floor. Ruby kept her hands wedged between her legs, walking with her legs pressed together, scissoring walking too. Each step she took was torture on her bladder as her golden liquid swisher and sloshed. The feeling was so uncomfortable, especially at the exit hole. She wished to unleash it here and now. But she had to keep going.

She remembered the gourds she had which only extended her thirst meter. But it didn't quench it. She remembered one of the villagers giving her a small cantina of wine and what it does to her. But at the moment she needed fluids in her body. She drank it little by little during the hiatus in fighting monsters. She had to do this to stay awake. It temporarily helped her to stay awake and she could hold her liquor. But it would affect her bladder. She needed water, and fast. At least she had water bottles.
