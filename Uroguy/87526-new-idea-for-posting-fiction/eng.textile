I was thinking about a female (one I have written about) having a scenario of pee desperation as a car wash worker in the summer heat. It could be to raise money for a cause and the person has to keep up hydration in the 100 + degrees of heat. Eventually, she ends up bursting during a busy pile up of cars waiting to be manually washed. She can't hold it and pees while dousing herself with water from a hose. I'm not sure though.
