Kind of a sequel to this

. AJ asked Rainbow Dash to help her hold it like she does, this is the results.

###

Applejack rocked on her bed, her knees pulled up to her chest. Her bedroom was hot- stuffy, which did little to help soothe her sore bladder. Perhaps, if the she-devil guarding the door would let her out for a moment, it'd make things easier.

"H- How much longer?"

"About... 15 minutes, give or take." Rainbow Dash didn't bother to check the clock. With three mugs of apple cider, several bottles of water, and 3 hours of holding to boot, she doubted her friend would even make it five minutes, let alone 15.

"I ain't g- gah-" She squeezed her hind hooves together, a leak almost escaping. "Gonna m-make it that long."

"You can. Besides, you were the one who asked me to help."

"I wasn't expectin' it to be this hard." AJ rubbed her bulge gently. Dash grinned.

"Hey, you asked me to help you out here, and I never do anything second-rate when it's for my friends."

"Mmhm..." The orange woman rolled her eyes. "'Cept when it's got somethin' to do with hard labor."

"There's a reason I stick to the skies instead of the corn fields."

A few moments of silence passed.

"Celestia, I gotta go." She slid off the bed, pacing in front of the bed. "How long did you say you usually last?"

"Four hours, give or take. Maybe five if I put my mind to it?"

AJ stood in place for a moment. Her hooves bounced, with the occasional tremble. "Oh, screw it." She turned towards the door, only for Dash to step in front of her.

"Not yet." She said. The orange pony snickered.

"Good joke, now lemme through." She placed a hoof on RD shoulder, trying to push her to the side. Her friend steadfastly held her position, even against her strongest pushes and nudges. The smile slowly disappeared. "C'mon Dash, it was funny for a second, now let me through."

"You said three hours and thirty minutes, AJ. You still have 12 minutes left."

"Dash, I gotta go!" She paced in place, her groin tensing up as she tried to hold back any leaks.

"You'll manage."

"But..." Applejack paused, giving her a nasty look before turning away. Dash may have snuck a look or two at her trembling hind legs as she passed.

"I drank everythin' you handed me..." She hissed through her teeth. "All those bottles of water... The cider..."

"The three cans of soda, too."

"Ain't that enough for this? It's been hours, why don't you just let me through?"

"You specifically told me not to-"

"I know, but I'm tellin' ya now to let me through!" She stood up again, stomping her right forehoof. A splash of liquid collided with the wooden floor, pulling a gasp out of the farmer. She sat back down, pressing both forehoof into her crotch.

"You're starting to leak already?" RD questioned, holding back a grin. "You still have 10 minutes left. At this rate, you'll be soaked by the time I let you out."

AJ took a deep breath, remaining hunched over for a minute or two, before leaning back up and staring at her captor through errant strands of her blonde hair. "You're enjoying this, ain't'cha?" She stood back up, scooting back up on to the bed. "Watchin' me 'bout to wet myself. Squirmin' around, tryin' not to pee."

"Maybe a liiiiiitle bit." She smiled.

"Darned pervert... I oughta..." Another leak ran down her leg, interrupting her train of thought.

"Dammit!" She cursed, almost hopping off the bed. A stain had been left on the sheets, about the size of a quarter. "Ya see?! I can't wait!"

"You still have about... Six minutes."

"I can't wait that long!" She quickly walked up to her. "Dash, you gotta let me through!"

"It'll be worse if I do."

"I don't care! I need to go!"

RD shrugged, pushing the door open and stepping out. AJ rushed out as fast as her hooves would carry her, waddling through the empty hall of her house and towards the bathroom. A rainbow-colored blur dashed past her, shoving the door open and closing it. AJ groaned.

"Dash!"

"I told you it'd be worse."

Applejack groaned, leaning up against the door. Her face had flushed into a dark shade of orange, her vision blurry and her eyes water, and her bladder ached, bulging out an inch or two. She almost gave up right there, but her pride wouldn't allow her to.

"Dash, please..." She plead, another leak getting out. Most of her strength had gone into running to the bathroom. Her tank was running on fumes.

"Four minutes."

AJ could only moan as she tried to keep it in, leaning against the door. Her hind hooves were crushed together, both forehooves pressed into her crotch.

"How're you holding up?"

"Fuck off." She cursed beneath her breath. RD giggled from behind the door.

"Okay, okay, I'll open up."

AJ gasped, jumping up. A hissing noise bounced off the walls of her empty home, pee splattering against the hardwood floor.

The door cracked open before AJ burst through, finding her treacherous friend sitting atop the closed toilet lid.

"Two more minutes, that's all."

"Please..." AJ groaned. "I- I really can't-" Another squirt came out, managing to last a second or two before she plugged it. Her face strained, sweat-covered strands on her blonde hair clinging to her forehead, leaning down to press her hooves into her crotch.

"You look so hot right now..." Dash whispered, a light blush over her face and nose. Unfortunately, but AJ was too focused on keeping herself contained to her or acknowledge her.

"60 seconds, cowgirl."

AJ whimpered, her feet tapping against the floor. Her whole body shivered and trembled. She looked up at RD, still sitting up there, taking in every detail she could.

"50, 49, 48..."

Dash slowly stood up, pushing the toilet seat up. Her heart raced as she watched her friend's display of willpower. It excited her as much as if she were holding. Remember to breathe, Dash...

"40, 39, 38..."

Applejack gasped, a jet of pee shooting out and clattering against the wooden floor, opening up the floodgates. Her hooves moved to plug the leak, but it was much too late- it was too much to hold and felt too good to stop.

Rainbow Dash quickly pushed AJ onto the toilet. AJ gasped as her pee crashed against the porcelain, her eyes glassy. The relief she felt was... unimaginable. She didn't know it was possible to feel so good.

She took a few breaths as her stream slowly died off. Applejack blinked a few times before looking around. RD stood in front of her, her mouth opened slightly, staring at her.

"You... Really had to go..."

"I told you." She sighed, blushing again, embarrassed slightly. "You're cleanin' this up. I need a shower." AJ stood up. A cold one...

RD shook her head, waking herself from the trance. "Alright... Yeah, sorry." She nodded. "Did you enjoy it, at least?"

AJ's face became as red as an apple.

"M... Maybe a little bit..." She admitted, though they both knew she enjoyed this more than just, "a little bit."

"Yes!" Rainbow Dash pumped a fist in the air. "I knew this was your thing!"

"K-Kinda..." Her blush spread to the rest of her face.

"Now, of course, the goal is to pee inside the toilet..." She glanced towards the floor. A large puddle had formed in front of the toilet. "We'll still have to work on that."

"Oh, shut your trap and get the mop!" Applejack barked. Dash chuckled as she headed towards the door.

We'll have to do this again. Who knows, once she's better at holding it, maybe she could hold it longer than me. The rainbow haired mare pondered. We'll definitely have to test that theory out.

{{4 hours ago, JTeam_ said:

While you did a reasonably good job explaining the wetting part, there wasn't really any uh... plot. You kind of explained WHY the pee was there, but not really what the motive for holding it was or anything like that. I like desperation-wetting stuff, but I also enjoy plot, so uh... it feels kinda off balance.

If I'm being totally honest, the story was supposed to start before the actual hold, sort of explaining it and why AJ and RD were doing the hold. I had it my phone, but it died while I was still writing it. I still wanted to get it out, so I(very lazily) just wrote up and posted this. I'll try and get the first part and edit them together.

Aaaaand here you go. I didn't know whether or not to just make a separate post or not for this, so I'll just keep this here.

"Drink."

Rainbow Dash held a bottle of water up her friend, Applejack. She stared at it for a moment, rolling her eyes and taking a sip.

"Why the hay do I have to drink so much? Third bottle you've gave me."

"You have to have a lot of fluids. Got to have pee to hold." She chuckled. They had decided that AJ's bedroom would probably be the best place to start holding at. The door was shut, the room was freshly cleaned(with a towel folded on the nightstand just in case), and their saddlebags at the foot of the bed.

"Besides, you were the one who wanted to try this out."

"I know," Applejack shifted up slightly, scooting up on her bed, the bright green sheets wrinkling against her movements. Her hind hooves resting against the wooden bed frame. "But ya could at least give me somethin' with some flavor."

"I will, eventually. But for right now..." She held it back up to her. AJ frowned, taking a big gulp out of the bottle.

"How're you feeling right now?"

"Fine, I guess." She shrugged her shoulders. "Don't need to go, not really."

"And when was the last time you went?"

"When I had lunch a couple hours ago."

"Alright..." She nodded. "Go ahead and finish up this up, then we'll be done with drinking for a while."

"Thank Celestia..." AJ mumbled under her breath. She chugged down the last half of the bottle, sitting it back beside RD.

"How often do ya do this sorta thing?"

"Depends on how busy I am." RD leaned back into the mattress, placing her hooves under her head. "Usually once a week, maybe twice."

"Are you good at it?"

RD scoffed. "Please. I don't even try half the time."

The orange woman deadpanned. "Really?"

"Mmhm!"

"What's the longest you could hold it then, doin' what you're showing me right now."

"Well..." Rainbow Dash glanced away. "Three hours, give or take. Maybe four if I put my mind to it. I am getting better, though."

"Mm-hm..." AJ cleared her throat.

"So, why do you want to try this anyway? Never would've guessed this was your thing too."

"It ain't my 'thing.'" She looked down at her, a small blush to contrast with her orange fur. "Well, maybe a little... Don't really know. Never get the time to, with the farm 'n all." She laid down beside her. "Only time I really don't have much to do is Winter, but then there's the holidays, relatives... By the time I got time to do it, Cider season starts up and I've gotta work on that."

"Why not just hold it after you get done with the farmwork?"

"And risk Apple Bloom or Big Mac catchin' me? No, thank you!"

RD shrugged her shoulders. "I do it all the time. How do you think I spiced up all those dumb parties Pinkie threw after Twi's brother got married?"

Applejack blushed a deep red, turning away. "I c-can't believe..."

"What?" She grinned deviously, sitting up. "Last time was probably the hardest, but where's the fun in doing it the easy way?

"You drank a whole jug of apple cider... Y- You held all that?"

"Mmhm." Dash leaned over to her ear. "Isn't is exciting?" She whispered

AJ shot up, almost hopping off the bed. "Well, heh- I-I think I'm gonna a go grab somethin' to drink!"

"C'mon AJ, there's no shame in admitting you like holding."

She opened her mouth to shoot back, yet only a awkward groan. "I'm gonna need some cider for this."

"Make sure you grab me some."

Applejack quickly made her exit, taking a few minutes before she returned with a wooden plate pinched between her teeth, a large, green pitcher of her own homemade apple cider with two small glasses sat to the side. She sat it on the nightstand, picking up the pitcher and poured their drinks.

"You really need to give us this stuff more often. Makes things a lot more fun." She scooted to the edge of the bed, lifting up her drink and downing it. A shiver ran through her body, the sharp taste cutting through her. However, there was something missing about it...

"Aw, what?"

"Sorry, I don't feeling gettin' hammered when I gotta get up and work in the morning." AJ said, before drinking hers. She didn't react nearly as much as Dash did, but her forehooves did wobble a bit when she sat the glass back down

"Weak..." RD sighed. She poured AJ another cup before filling her own glass. "How're you holding up over there?"

"Fine." She said, chugging down the freshly filled mug. "Kinda feelin' something, but nothin' I can't handle.

"Let's work on that, shall we?" She filled AJ's mug again, flashing a cheeky grin, almost daring her to protest.

"... I'm gonna hate myself for doin' this later," She tossed the mug back, downing the cider.

"That's the spirit!"

A few moments of silence passed.

"Celestia, I gotta go." She slid off the bed, pacing in front of the bed.

"You can hold it, you're a big girl." RD taunted. Applejack glared at her,

"I ain't full enough not to come over there and hit'cha." She threatened. "Clear?"

"Crystal." Dash grinned. It was fun not to be the one holding for a change.

AJ stood in place for a moment. Her hooves bounced, with the occasional tremble. "Oh, screw it." She turned towards the door, only for Dash to step in front of her.
